# Source Code Documentation

This documentation is for the `module.exports` object in the source code file.

## Overview

The source code exports a module that contains a `plugins` object. This object has two properties: `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer`. Both properties are objects themselves, but they are empty, indicating that they are used without any additional configuration.

## Properties

### `plugins`

This is an object that contains all the plugins used in the module. It has two properties: `tailwindcss` and `autoprefixer`.

#### `tailwindcss`

This is a Tailwind CSS plugin. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. In this module, it's used without any additional configuration.

#### `autoprefixer`

This is an Autoprefixer plugin. Autoprefixer is a tool to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules using values from the Can I Use website. In this module, it's used without any additional configuration.

## Usage

This module is typically used in a postcss configuration file. The exported plugins object can be spread into the plugins array of the postcss configuration.

```javascript
const plugins = require('./path-to-this-file');

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ...plugins,
    // other plugins can go here
  ],
};
```

In the above example, replace `'./path-to-this-file'` with the actual path to the file that contains the module being documented here.
