# ChatPage Component

This is the main component for the chat page of the application. It handles the rendering of the chat UI, chat input, chat settings, quick settings, and chat help components. It also handles the logic for initiating a new chat and focusing on the chat input field.

## Import Statements

```javascript
import { ChatHelp } from "@/components/chat/chat-help"
import { useChatHandler } from "@/components/chat/chat-hooks/use-chat-handler"
import { ChatInput } from "@/components/chat/chat-input"
import { ChatSettings } from "@/components/chat/chat-settings"
import { ChatUI } from "@/components/chat/chat-ui"

import { ChatbotUIContext } from "@/context/context"
import useHotkey from "@/lib/hooks/use-hotkey"
import { useTheme } from "next-themes"
import { useContext } from "react"
```

## Main Function

The main function `ChatPage()` uses the `useHotkey` hook to bind the "o" and "l" keys to the `handleNewChat` and `handleFocusChatInput` functions respectively. It also uses the `useContext` hook to access the `chatMessages` from the `ChatbotUIContext` and the `useChatHandler` hook to get the `handleNewChat` and `handleFocusChatInput` functions. The `useTheme` hook is used to get the current theme.

## Return Statement

The return statement checks if there are any chat messages. If there are no chat messages, it renders the `Brand`, `QuickSettings`, `ChatSettings`, `ChatInput`, and `ChatHelp` components. If there are chat messages, it renders the `ChatUI` component.
