## Overview

The `ChatIDPage` component is a simple function component that returns the `ChatUI` component. This component is part of the chatbot user interface and is used to display the chat interface for a specific chat identified by its ID.

## Code Breakdown

```ts
"use client"

import { ChatUI } from "@/components/chat/chat-ui"

export default function ChatIDPage() {
  return <ChatUI />
}
```

### Importing Dependencies

```ts
"use client"

import { ChatUI } from "@/components/chat/chat-ui"
```

The `"use client"` directive at the top of the file indicates that this code is intended to run on the client side. This is followed by importing the `ChatUI` component from the `chat-ui` file located in the `chat` directory of the `components` directory.

### ChatIDPage Function Component

```ts
export default function ChatIDPage() {
  return <ChatUI />
}
```

The `ChatIDPage` function is a React component that returns the `ChatUI` component. This function is exported as the default export of the module, meaning it can be imported with any name in other files.

## Usage

The `ChatIDPage` component can be used in any part of the application where the chat interface needs to be displayed. Since it's a default export, it can be imported like this:

```ts
import AnyNameYouWant from '/path/to/chatid/page';
```

Then, it can be used in the JSX like any other component:

```ts
<AnyNameYouWant />
```

Remember to replace `AnyNameYouWant` with the actual name you want to use for the component, and `/path/to/chatid/page` with the actual path to the `page.tsx` file.
