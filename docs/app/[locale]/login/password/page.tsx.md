# ChangePasswordPage Component Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `ChangePasswordPage` component in the file `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/app/[locale]/login/password/page.tsx`. This component is used to handle the logic for changing a user's password.

## Code Overview

```ts
"use client"

import { ChangePassword } from "@/components/utility/change-password"
import { supabase } from "@/lib/supabase/browser-client"
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"

export default function ChangePasswordPage() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

  const router = useRouter()

  useEffect(() => {
    ;(async () => {
      const session = (await supabase.auth.getSession()).data.session

      if (!session) {
        router.push("/login")
      } else {
        setLoading(false)
      }
    })()
  }, [])

  if (loading) {
    return null
  }

  return <ChangePassword />
}
```

## Import Statements

The component imports several modules:

- `ChangePassword` component from the utility components. This component is used to render the change password form.
- `supabase` from the Supabase browser client library. This is used to interact with the Supabase backend, specifically to get the current user session.
- `useRouter` from Next.js navigation. This hook allows the component to navigate between different pages.
- `useEffect` and `useState` from React. These hooks are used to handle side effects and local state in the component.

## Component Definition

The `ChangePasswordPage` component is a default export from this module. It is a functional component that uses React hooks.

## State Variables

The component has a single state variable `loading` that is initially set to `true`. This variable is used to control the rendering of the component.

## useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook is used to perform a side effect after the component is rendered. In this case, it checks if the user is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated, it redirects them to the login page. If the user is authenticated, it sets the `loading` state to `false`.

## Conditional Rendering

The component uses conditional rendering based on the `loading` state. If `loading` is `true`, the component returns `null`, effectively rendering nothing. If `loading` is `false`, it renders the `ChangePassword` component.

## Summary

The `ChangePasswordPage` component is responsible for rendering the change password form to the user. It ensures that only authenticated users can access this page by checking the user's session and redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page.
