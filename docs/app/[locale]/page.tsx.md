# Chatbot UI Home Page Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `HomePage` function in the `page.tsx` file located in `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/app/[locale]/`. The function is responsible for rendering the home page of the Chatbot UI application.

## Code Summary

The `HomePage` function is a functional component in React that uses the Next.js framework. It renders the home page of the Chatbot UI application. The home page consists of a Chatbot UI logo, a title, and a button that redirects the user to the login page.

## Detailed Code Explanation

```ts
"use client"
```

This directive indicates that the code runs on the client side.

```ts
import { ChatbotUISVG } from "@/components/icons/chatbotui-svg"
import { IconArrowRight } from "@tabler/icons-react"
import { useTheme } from "next-themes"
import Link from "next/link"
```

These lines import the necessary components and hooks from their respective modules. `ChatbotUISVG` is a component that renders the Chatbot UI logo. `IconArrowRight` is an icon component from the `@tabler/icons-react` library. `useTheme` is a hook from the `next-themes` library that enables the application to support dark and light themes. `Link` is a component from Next.js that enables client-side transitions between routes.

```ts
export default function HomePage() {
  const { theme } = useTheme()
```

This line defines and exports the `HomePage` functional component. Inside the component, the `useTheme` hook is called to get the current theme.

```ts
  return (
    <div className="flex size-full flex-col items-center justify-center">
      <div>
        <ChatbotUISVG theme={theme === "dark" ? "dark" : "light"} scale={0.3} />
      </div>

      <div className="mt-2 text-4xl font-bold">Chatbot UI</div>

      <Link
        className="mt-4 flex w-[200px] items-center justify-center rounded-md bg-blue-500 p-2 font-semibold"
        href="/login"
      >
        Start Chatting
        <IconArrowRight className="ml-1" size={20} />
      </Link>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This part of the code returns the JSX to be rendered by the `HomePage` component. It includes a container `div` that uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. Inside the container, there are three child `div` elements:

- The first `div` contains the `ChatbotUISVG` component, which renders the Chatbot UI logo. The `theme` prop is set based on the current theme, and the `scale` prop is set to `0.3` to adjust the size of the logo.
- The second `div` displays the title "Chatbot UI".
- The third `div` contains a `Link` component that redirects the user to the login page when clicked. The `Link` component contains the text "Start Chatting" and an `IconArrowRight` component that renders a right arrow icon.
