# Help Page Component Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `HelpPage` component in the `page.tsx` file located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/app/[locale]/help/`.

## File Location

```
/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/app/[locale]/help/page.tsx
```

## Component Summary

The `HelpPage` component is a simple React component that is used to display a placeholder message indicating that the Help page is currently under construction. This component is part of a chatbot user interface application.

## Code Details

```ts
export default function HelpPage() {
  return (
    <div className="size-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
      <div className="text-4xl">Help under construction.</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Function: `HelpPage`

This is a default exported function that returns a JSX element. The function does not take any parameters.

#### JSX Element

The returned JSX element consists of a `div` element with several CSS classes applied to it:

- `size-screen`: This class is likely used to set the size of the `div` to match the screen size.
- `flex`: This class applies the CSS Flexbox layout to the `div`.
- `flex-col`: This class sets the direction of the Flexbox layout to column.
- `items-center`: This class centers the Flexbox items along the cross-axis (vertically, in this case).
- `justify-center`: This class centers the Flexbox items along the main axis (horizontally, in this case).

Inside this `div`, there is another `div` with the class `text-4xl` applied to it. This class likely increases the text size. The text inside this `div` is "Help under construction.", indicating that the Help page is not yet available.

## Conclusion

The `HelpPage` component is a simple placeholder for the Help page of the chatbot UI application. It uses CSS classes to style a message that informs users that the Help page is under construction.
