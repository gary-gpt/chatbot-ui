# HelpPage Function Documentation

## Overview

`HelpPage` is a default exported function that returns a JSX element. This function is typically used in a React.js context to render a help page on the user interface.

## Function Signature

```jsx
function HelpPage(): JSX.Element
```

## Return Value

The `HelpPage` function returns a JSX element that represents a help page. The returned JSX element has the following structure:

```jsx
<div className="size-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
  <div className="text-4xl">Help under construction.</div>
</div>
```

## Structure Description

The outer `div` is a container that uses several CSS classes to style its content:

- `size-screen`: This class is likely used to set the size of the container to match the screen size.
- `flex`: This class applies the CSS flexbox layout to the container, allowing its children to be laid out in any direction and have flexible widths and heights.
- `flex-col`: This class makes the main axis vertical, meaning the children of the container will be stacked vertically.
- `items-center`: This class aligns the container's children along the cross axis (horizontally) in the center.
- `justify-center`: This class aligns the container's children along the main axis (vertically) in the center.

Inside this container, there is another `div` with the text "Help under construction." This `div` uses the `text-4xl` class, which is likely used to set the text size.

## Usage

As a default exported function, `HelpPage` can be imported and used in another file like so:

```jsx
import HelpPage from './HelpPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <HelpPage />
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, `HelpPage` is used inside the `App` function to render the help page.
