# Source Code Documentation

This file is responsible for handling GET requests and returning a response indicating whether certain environment keys are being used. The environment keys are associated with various API providers such as Azure, OpenAI, Google, etc.

## Imports

- `isUsingEnvironmentKey` from "@/lib/envs": A function to check if a specific environment key is being used.
- `createResponse` from "@/lib/server/server-utils": A utility function to create server responses.
- `EnvKey` from "@/types/key-type": A type definition for environment keys.
- `VALID_ENV_KEYS` from "@/types/valid-keys": An enumeration of valid environment keys.

## Function: GET

An asynchronous function that handles GET requests.

### Process

1. Defines a mapping (`envKeyMap`) between string identifiers and valid environment keys.
2. Creates a new object (`isUsingEnvKeyMap`) that maps each provider to a boolean value indicating whether the corresponding environment key is being used. This is done by reducing over the keys of `envKeyMap`, and for each key, checking if it is being used with the `isUsingEnvironmentKey` function.
3. Returns a response with `isUsingEnvKeyMap` and a status code of 200.

### Return

- Returns a response object with a status code of 200 and a body containing `isUsingEnvKeyMap`, a mapping of each provider to a boolean indicating whether the corresponding environment key is being used.

### Usage

This function can be used to check which environment keys are currently being used in the application.
