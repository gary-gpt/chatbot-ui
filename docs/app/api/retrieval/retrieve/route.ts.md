# POST Function Documentation

This function is an asynchronous function named `POST` that takes a `request` object as an argument and returns a `Response` object.

## Import Statements

The function imports several modules and functions:

- `generateLocalEmbedding` from "@/lib/generate-local-embedding"
- `checkApiKey` and `getServerProfile` from "@/lib/server/server-chat-helpers"
- `Database` from "@/supabase/types"
- `createClient` from "@supabase/supabase-js"
- `OpenAI` from "openai"

## Function Parameters

The function accepts a single parameter:

- `request`: A `Request` object that contains the HTTP request information.

## Function Logic

1. The function first parses the JSON body of the request into a JavaScript object. The object is then destructured into several variables: `userInput`, `fileIds`, `embeddingsProvider`, and `sourceCount`.

2. It then creates a new Set from the `fileIds` array to remove any duplicate file IDs and assigns it to `uniqueFileIds`.

3. The function then creates a new Supabase client using the Supabase URL and service role key from the environment variables.

4. It retrieves the server profile and checks if the `embeddingsProvider` is set to "openai". If it is, it checks if the server profile is using Azure OpenAI. If it is, it checks the Azure OpenAI API key. If it's not using Azure OpenAI, it checks the OpenAI API key.

5. Depending on whether the server profile is using Azure OpenAI or not, it creates a new instance of OpenAI with the appropriate configuration.

6. If the `embeddingsProvider` is set to "openai", it creates a new embedding using the OpenAI API and maps the resulting data to an array of embeddings. It then uses the Supabase client to call a stored procedure named "match_file_items_openai" with the embedding, source count, and unique file IDs as arguments. If an error occurs during this process, it throws the error.

7. If the `embeddingsProvider` is set to "local", it generates a local embedding and calls a stored procedure named "match_file_items_local" with the embedding, source count, and unique file IDs as arguments. If an error occurs during this process, it throws the error.

8. The function then sorts the resulting array of chunks in descending order based on their similarity and assigns it to `mostSimilarChunks`.

9. Finally, the function returns a new `Response` object with a status of 200 and a body containing a JSON string of the most similar chunks.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs at any point during the function, it catches the error and returns a new `Response` object with a status of 500 (or the status from the error if it exists) and a body containing a JSON string with a message describing the error.
