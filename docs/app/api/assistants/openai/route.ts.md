# Source Code Documentation

## Import Statements

The source code begins by importing necessary modules and functions:

- `checkApiKey` and `getServerProfile` functions from the `server-chat-helpers` file in the `server` directory.
- `ServerRuntime` from the `next` package.
- `OpenAI` from the `openai` package.

## Runtime Configuration

The `runtime` constant is set to `"edge"`, which is a value of the `ServerRuntime` type.

## GET Function

The `GET` function is an asynchronous function that interacts with the OpenAI API. 

### Function Flow

1. The function starts by retrieving the server profile using the `getServerProfile` function.

2. The OpenAI API key from the server profile is then validated using the `checkApiKey` function. 

3. An instance of `OpenAI` is created using the API key and organization ID from the server profile.

4. The function then retrieves a list of up to 100 assistants from the OpenAI API using the `list` method from `openai.beta.assistants`.

5. If the operations are successful, the function returns a `Response` object with a status of 200 and a body containing the list of assistants in JSON format.

### Error Handling

If an error occurs at any point during the execution of the function, an error message is generated and a `Response` object is returned. The status of the response is set to the error status if available, or 500 by default. The body of the response contains the error message in JSON format.
