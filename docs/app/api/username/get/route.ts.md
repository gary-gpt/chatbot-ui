# Source Code Documentation

This source code file is a part of a serverless function that handles HTTP POST requests. It is designed to interact with a Supabase database.

## Imports

The file begins by importing the necessary modules:

- `Database` from "@/supabase/types" - This is a type definition for the Supabase database.
- `createClient` from "@supabase/supabase-js" - This is a function that creates a new Supabase client.

## Constants

The `runtime` constant is set to "edge", indicating that this function is intended to run at the edge of the network, close to the user.

## POST Function

The `POST` function is an asynchronous function that handles HTTP POST requests. It takes one argument, `request`, which is an object of type `Request`.

The function begins by extracting the `userId` from the JSON body of the request.

Then, it creates a new Supabase client using the `createClient` function. The URL and service role key for the Supabase client are retrieved from the environment variables.

Next, the function attempts to select the `username` from the `profiles` table in the database where the `user_id` matches the `userId` from the request. It expects to retrieve a single record.

If no data is retrieved, the function throws an error with the message from the Supabase error. If data is retrieved, the function returns a response with a status of 200 and the `username` in the body of the response.

If any other error occurs during the execution of the function, it catches the error and returns a response with a status of 500 and the error message in the body of the response.

## Error Handling

The error handling in this function is robust. It checks for both the presence of data and the absence of errors when interacting with the Supabase database. If an error occurs, it is caught and handled gracefully, with an appropriate HTTP status code and error message returned in the response.
