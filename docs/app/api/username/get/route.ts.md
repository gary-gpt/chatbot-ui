# Chatbot UI - Username API

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `route.ts` file located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/app/api/username/get/`. This file is a part of the Chatbot UI application and is responsible for fetching a user's username from the database.

## Code Overview

The `route.ts` file is a TypeScript file that exports an asynchronous function `POST`. This function is designed to handle HTTP POST requests. The function retrieves the user's ID from the request body, connects to the Supabase database, and fetches the username associated with the provided user ID.

## Code Breakdown

```ts
import { Database } from "@/supabase/types"
import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js"
```

The file begins by importing the necessary modules. `Database` is a type from the local `supabase/types` module, and `createClient` is a function from the `supabase-js` library.

```ts
export const runtime = "edge"
```

The `runtime` constant is exported with the value of "edge". This specifies the environment in which the code will be run.

```ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const json = await request.json()
  const { userId } = json as {
    userId: string
  }
```

The `POST` function is exported. It is an asynchronous function that takes a `request` object as its argument. The function begins by parsing the request body into JSON format and extracting the `userId` property.

```ts
const supabaseAdmin = createClient<Database>(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!
)
```

A Supabase client is created using the `createClient` function. The URL and service role key for the Supabase database are retrieved from the environment variables.

```ts
const { data, error } = await supabaseAdmin
  .from("profiles")
  .select("username")
  .eq("user_id", userId)
  .single()
```

The function then queries the `profiles` table in the database, selecting the `username` field for the record where the `user_id` matches the provided `userId`. The `.single()` method is used to return only one record.

```ts
if (!data) {
  throw new Error(error.message)
}
```

If no data is returned (i.e., there is no user with the provided ID), an error is thrown.

```ts
return new Response(JSON.stringify({ username: data.username }), {
  status: 200
})
```

If the query is successful, the function returns a response with a status of 200 and the username in the body.

```ts
catch (error: any) {
  const errorMessage = error.error?.message || "An unexpected error occurred"
  const errorCode = error.status || 500
  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: errorMessage }), {
    status: errorCode
  })
}
```

If any error occurs during the execution of the function, a response with a status of 500 (or the status associated with the error) and a message detailing the error is returned.
