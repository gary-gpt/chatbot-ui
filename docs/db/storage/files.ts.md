# Chatbot UI - File Storage Operations

This TypeScript file (`files.ts`) is part of a chatbot user interface and is responsible for handling file storage operations. It uses the Supabase client to interact with the storage and the Sonner library to display toast notifications.

## Code Overview

The file contains three exported functions:

- `uploadFile`: Uploads a file to the storage.
- `deleteFileFromStorage`: Deletes a file from the storage.
- `getFileFromStorage`: Retrieves a file from the storage.

## Functions Detail

### Upload File

```ts
export const uploadFile = async (
  file: File,
  payload: {
    name: string
    user_id: string
    file_id: string
  }
) => {
  //...
}
```

This function uploads a file to the storage. It takes two parameters: `file` (the file to be uploaded) and `payload` (an object containing the file's metadata).

The function first checks if the file size exceeds the limit specified in the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_USER_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT`. If the file size is too large, it throws an error.

The file is then uploaded to the storage under a path constructed from the user ID and file ID. If an error occurs during the upload, the function throws an error.

### Delete File from Storage

```ts
export const deleteFileFromStorage = async (filePath: string) => {
  //...
}
```

This function deletes a file from the storage. It takes one parameter: `filePath` (the path of the file to be deleted).

The function attempts to delete the file from the storage. If an error occurs during the deletion, it displays a toast notification and returns early.

### Get File from Storage

```ts
export const getFileFromStorage = async (filePath: string) => {
  //...
}
```

This function retrieves a file from the storage. It takes one parameter: `filePath` (the path of the file to be retrieved).

The function attempts to create a signed URL for the file, which is valid for 24 hours. If an error occurs during this process, it logs the error and throws an error.

## Error Handling

Each function includes error handling to ensure that any issues encountered during the file operations are appropriately handled and communicated. This includes throwing errors and displaying toast notifications.
