# File Operations

This module provides a set of functions for performing operations on files, such as creating, updating, and deleting files. It also includes functions for retrieving files by their ID and workspace ID.

## Functions

### getFileById(fileId: string)

This function retrieves a file by its ID. It throws an error if the file is not found.

### getFileWorkspacesByWorkspaceId(workspaceId: string)

This function retrieves a workspace by its ID, along with all the files associated with that workspace. It throws an error if the workspace is not found.

### getFileWorkspacesByFileId(fileId: string)

This function retrieves a file by its ID, along with all the workspaces associated with that file. It throws an error if the file is not found.

### createFileBasedOnExtension(file: File, fileRecord: TablesInsert<"files">, workspace_id: string, embeddingsProvider: "openai" | "local")

This function creates a file based on its extension. If the file extension is "docx", it extracts the raw text from the file using the `mammoth` library and creates a docx file. Otherwise, it creates a regular file.

### createFile(file: File, fileRecord: TablesInsert<"files">, workspace_id: string, embeddingsProvider: "openai" | "local")

This function creates a regular file. It also processes the file for retrieval and throws an error if the processing fails.

### createDocXFile(text: string, file: File, fileRecord: TablesInsert<"files">, workspace_id: string, embeddingsProvider: "openai" | "local")

This function creates a docx file. It also processes the file for retrieval and throws an error if the processing fails.

### createFiles(files: TablesInsert<"files">[], workspace_id: string)

This function creates multiple files at once.

### createFileWorkspace(item: { user_id: string, file_id: string, workspace_id: string })

This function creates a file workspace, which is a relationship between a file and a workspace.

### createFileWorkspaces(items: { user_id: string; file_id: string; workspace_id: string }[])

This function creates multiple file workspaces at once.

### updateFile(fileId: string, file: TablesUpdate<"files">)

This function updates a file by its ID.

### deleteFile(fileId: string)

This function deletes a file by its ID.

### deleteFileWorkspace(fileId: string, workspaceId: string)

This function deletes a file workspace, which is a relationship between a file and a workspace.
