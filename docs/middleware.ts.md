# Middleware.js Documentation

This file contains a middleware function for handling requests and a configuration object for matching routes.

## Imports

- `createClient` from "@/lib/supabase/middleware"
- `i18nRouter` from "next-i18n-router"
- `NextResponse` and `NextRequest` types from "next/server"
- `i18nConfig` from the current directory

## Functions

### middleware(request: NextRequest)

This function is an asynchronous function that takes a `NextRequest` object as an argument.

The function first tries to handle the request with the `i18nRouter` function. If the `i18nRouter` function returns a result, the middleware function immediately returns this result.

If the `i18nRouter` function does not return a result, the middleware function creates a Supabase client and retrieves the current session.

If the session exists and the requested URL is the root ("/"), the function queries the Supabase database for the workspace associated with the current user that is marked as "home". If such a workspace does not exist, the function throws an error.

If the "home" workspace exists, the function redirects the user to the chat page of this workspace.

If the session does not exist or the requested URL is not the root, the function returns the response from the Supabase client.

If any error occurs during the execution of the function, the function returns a `NextResponse` object with the request headers.

## Objects

### config

This object contains a `matcher` property, which is a regular expression string that matches any URL that does not contain "api", "static", any file extension, "_next", or "auth".
