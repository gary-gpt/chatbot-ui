# Chatbot UI Environment Key Checker

This document explains the purpose and logic of the TypeScript file located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/lib/envs.ts`. This file contains a function that checks if a specific environment key is being used.

## Code Summary

The `envs.ts` file exports a single function `isUsingEnvironmentKey()`. This function takes an environment key of type `EnvKey` as an argument and checks if this key is present in the environment variables. If the key is found, the function returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.

## Code Breakdown

```ts
// Importing the EnvKey type from "@/types/key-type"
import { EnvKey } from "@/types/key-type"
```

The above line imports the `EnvKey` type from the `key-type` file located in the `types` directory. `EnvKey` is a type that represents the keys of the environment variables.

```ts
// Function that checks if a specific environment key is being used
export function isUsingEnvironmentKey(type: EnvKey) {
  return Boolean(process.env[type])
}
```

The `isUsingEnvironmentKey()` function is exported for use in other files. It accepts one argument, `type`, which is of type `EnvKey`. 

The function checks if the `type` key exists in the environment variables by accessing `process.env[type]`. If the key exists, `process.env[type]` will return a truthy value (the value of the key), and if it doesn't exist, it will return a falsy value (`undefined`). 

The `Boolean()` function is used to convert the returned value to a boolean. This ensures that the function always returns a boolean value (`true` or `false`), regardless of the actual value of the environment variable.

## Conclusion

The `envs.ts` file provides a utility function to check if a specific environment variable key is being used. This can be useful in scenarios where the application's behavior depends on the presence of certain environment variables.
