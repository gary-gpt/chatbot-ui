# Documentation for insertMemory.ts

This file is located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/lib/memory/insertMemory.ts`. It contains a single function `insertMemory` that is used to insert a new memory into the `memory` table in a Supabase database.

## Importing Dependencies

```ts
import { supabase } from "@/lib/supabase/browser-client"
```

The file imports the `supabase` client from the `browser-client` file in the `supabase` directory. This client is used to interact with the Supabase database.

## InsertMemoryParams Type

```ts
export type InsertMemoryParams = {
  project_name: string
  category: string
  content: string
  tags?: string
}
```

The `InsertMemoryParams` type is an object that represents a memory. It has the following properties:

- `project_name`: The name of the project associated with the memory.
- `category`: The category of the memory.
- `content`: The content of the memory.
- `tags`: Optional tags associated with the memory.

## insertMemory Function

```ts
export async function insertMemory(memory: InsertMemoryParams) {
  ...
}
```

The `insertMemory` function is an asynchronous function that inserts a new memory into the `memory` table in the Supabase database. It takes a single argument `memory` of type `InsertMemoryParams`.

### Function Logic

1. The function first logs a message to the console indicating that it is attempting a simple select operation on the `memory` table.

2. It then performs a select operation on the `memory` table, selecting all columns and limiting the result to 1 row. The result of this operation is logged to the console.

3. The function then logs a message to the console indicating that it is attempting to insert the `memory` object into the `memory` table.

4. The function performs the insert operation, inserting the `memory` object into the `memory` table. It then selects all columns from the inserted row(s). The result of this operation is destructured into `data`, `error`, `status`, and `statusText`.

5. The function logs the `data`, `error`, `status`, and `statusText` to the console.

6. If there was an error with the insert operation, the function throws an error with the error message or a default error message.

7. If there was no error, the function returns the `data`.

This function is used to insert new memories into the `memory` table in the Supabase database. It logs all operations and results to the console for debugging purposes.
