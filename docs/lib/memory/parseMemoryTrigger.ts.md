## Function: `parseMemoryTrigger`

This function is used to parse a memory trigger. Currently, it is a temporary stub, and the memory trigger system is disabled for modular testing.

### Syntax

```typescript
parseMemoryTrigger(_input: string): {
  isMemoryTrigger: boolean
  memoryContent: string
  tags?: string
  category?: string
  needsConfirmation?: boolean
}
```

### Parameters

- `_input` (string): The input string to be parsed.

### Return Value

The function returns an object with the following properties:

- `isMemoryTrigger` (boolean): This property indicates whether the input is a memory trigger. In the current stub, this is always `false`.
- `memoryContent` (string): This property contains the content of the memory. In the current stub, this is always an empty string.
- `tags` (string, optional): This property contains the tags associated with the memory. In the current stub, this is always an empty string.
- `category` (string, optional): This property contains the category of the memory. In the current stub, this is always an empty string.
- `needsConfirmation` (boolean, optional): This property indicates whether the memory trigger needs confirmation. In the current stub, this is always `false`.

### Example

```typescript
const result = parseMemoryTrigger("some input string");
console.log(result);
// Output: { isMemoryTrigger: false, memoryContent: "", tags: "", category: "", needsConfirmation: false }
```

### Note

This function is currently a stub and does not perform any parsing. The memory trigger system is disabled for modular testing.
