# Supabase Client Creation

This module exports a Supabase client instance for use throughout your application. 

## Dependencies

This module relies on two dependencies:

- `@supabase/types`: This package provides TypeScript types for the Supabase client.
- `@supabase/ssr`: This package provides a function to create a Supabase client suitable for use in a browser environment.

## Environment Variables

This module expects two environment variables:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: The URL of your Supabase instance. This should be a string.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: The anonymous key for your Supabase instance. This should be a string.

## Exported Values

### `supabase`

This is the primary export of the module. It is a Supabase client instance, configured with the provided environment variables.

```typescript
export const supabase = createBrowserClient<Database>(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
)
```

The `createBrowserClient` function is called with two arguments: the Supabase URL and the anonymous key. The `!` operator is used to assert that these values are not `null` or `undefined`.

The `<Database>` generic is used to specify the type of the database that the client will be interacting with. This should match the structure of your Supabase database.

## Usage

You can import the `supabase` client into your application like so:

```typescript
import { supabase } from './path/to/this/module'
```

Then, you can use the `supabase` client to interact with your Supabase database:

```typescript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('my-table')
  .select('*')
```

Please refer to the [Supabase documentation](https://supabase.io/docs/guide/javascript) for more information on how to use the Supabase client.
