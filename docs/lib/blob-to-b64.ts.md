## Function: convertBlobToBase64

This function is used to convert a Blob object into a Base64 encoded string. 

### Syntax

```javascript
convertBlobToBase64(blob)
```

### Parameters

- **blob** (Blob): The Blob object that you want to convert to a Base64 string.

### Returns

A Promise that resolves with a Base64 encoded string.

### Errors

If an error occurs during the conversion process, the Promise will be rejected with the error.

### Example

```javascript
const blob = new Blob(['Hello, world!'], { type: 'text/plain' })
convertBlobToBase64(blob)
  .then(base64 => console.log(base64))
  .catch(error => console.error(error))
```

In this example, the text 'Hello, world!' is converted into a Blob object, which is then passed to the `convertBlobToBase64` function. The function returns a Promise that resolves with the Base64 encoded string of the Blob object. If an error occurs during the conversion process, the Promise is rejected and the error is logged to the console.

### Implementation

The function uses the FileReader API to read the Blob object as a data URL, which is a Base64 encoded string. When the reading process is completed, the Promise is resolved with the result. If an error occurs during the reading process, the Promise is rejected with the error.
