# Chatbot UI Retrieval Processing

This file is located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/lib/retrieval/processing/index.ts`. It is a part of the retrieval processing module of a chatbot user interface library. The purpose of this module is to handle the processing of different file formats for the chatbot.

## Code Summary

This module exports functionalities from several other modules, each responsible for processing a specific file format. The file formats supported by this module are CSV, DOCX, JSON, Markdown (MD), PDF, and TXT. 

Additionally, it also exports two constants, `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP`, which are used for processing large files in chunks.

## Code Details

```ts
export * from "./csv"
export * from "./docx"
export * from "./json"
export * from "./md"
export * from "./pdf"
export * from "./txt"
```

These lines of code are exporting everything (`*`) from the respective modules. Each of these modules is responsible for processing a specific file format. For example, `./csv` is responsible for processing CSV files, `./docx` is responsible for processing DOCX files, and so on.

```ts
export const CHUNK_SIZE = 4000
export const CHUNK_OVERLAP = 200
```

These lines of code are exporting two constants, `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP`. 

- `CHUNK_SIZE`: This constant is used to define the size of each chunk when processing large files. The value `4000` suggests that the file will be divided into chunks of 4000 units each for processing.

- `CHUNK_OVERLAP`: This constant is used to define the overlap between two consecutive chunks when processing large files. The value `200` suggests that there will be an overlap of 200 units between two consecutive chunks.

These constants are useful when dealing with large files, as they allow the file to be processed in smaller, more manageable pieces, rather than all at once. This can help to improve performance and reduce memory usage.
