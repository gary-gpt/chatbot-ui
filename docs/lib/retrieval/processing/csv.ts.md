# Documentation for csv.ts

This TypeScript file, `csv.ts`, is located in the `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/lib/retrieval/processing/` directory. It is responsible for processing CSV files and splitting the content into manageable chunks.

## Imports

The file begins by importing several modules and constants:

- `FileItemChunk` from "@/types": This is a custom type definition used for the chunks of text that will be processed.
- `encode` from "gpt-tokenizer": This function is used to tokenize the text content of the chunks.
- `CSVLoader` from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/csv": This class is used to load the CSV file.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from "langchain/text_splitter": This class is used to split the text content into chunks.
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP` and `CHUNK_SIZE` from ".": These constants define the size of the chunks and the overlap between them.

## processCSV Function

The main function in this file is `processCSV`. This is an asynchronous function that takes a CSV file as a Blob and returns a promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

### Function Logic

1. The function begins by creating a new instance of `CSVLoader` with the provided CSV file and loading the documents from the file.

2. It then concatenates all the page content from the documents into a single string, `completeText`, with two newline characters ("\n\n") between each document's content.

3. A new instance of `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` is created with the specified `chunkSize`, `chunkOverlap`, and `separators`. This splitter is then used to split `completeText` into smaller documents.

4. An empty array, `chunks`, is created to hold the `FileItemChunk` objects.

5. A for loop is used to iterate over the split documents. For each document, an object is created with the document's page content and the number of tokens in the content (determined by the `encode` function). This object is then pushed to the `chunks` array.

6. Finally, the function returns the `chunks` array.

```ts
export const processCSV = async (csv: Blob): Promise<FileItemChunk[]> => {
  const loader = new CSVLoader(csv)
  const docs = await loader.load()
  let completeText = docs.map(doc => doc.pageContent).join("\n\n")

  const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
    chunkSize: CHUNK_SIZE,
    chunkOverlap: CHUNK_OVERLAP,
    separators: ["\n\n"]
  })
  const splitDocs = await splitter.createDocuments([completeText])

  let chunks: FileItemChunk[] = []

  for (let i = 0; i < splitDocs.length; i++) {
    const doc = splitDocs[i]

    chunks.push({
      content: doc.pageContent,
      tokens: encode(doc.pageContent).length
    })
  }

  return chunks
}
```

This function is exported, meaning it can be imported and used in other files.
