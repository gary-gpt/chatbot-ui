# processTxt Function Documentation

## Import Statements

```typescript
import { FileItemChunk } from "@/types"
import { encode } from "gpt-tokenizer"
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter"
import { CHUNK_OVERLAP, CHUNK_SIZE } from "."
```

## Function Signature

```typescript
export const processTxt = async (txt: Blob): Promise<FileItemChunk[]>
```

## Description

The `processTxt` function is an asynchronous function that takes a Blob object as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

## Parameters

- `txt` (Blob): A Blob object that represents the text to be processed.

## Returns

- Promise<FileItemChunk[]>: A Promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

## Functionality

1. The function first converts the Blob object into an ArrayBuffer and then into a Buffer object.
2. It then creates a TextDecoder object with "utf-8" encoding and uses it to decode the Buffer object into a string.
3. A `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` object is created with `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP` as parameters.
4. The `createDocuments` method of the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` object is called with the decoded text content as an argument, which splits the text into multiple documents.
5. An empty array `chunks` of type `FileItemChunk[]` is initialized.
6. The function then iterates over the split documents. For each document, it pushes a new `FileItemChunk` object to the `chunks` array. This object contains the document content and the length of the encoded document content.
7. Finally, the function returns the `chunks` array.

## Usage

This function is used to process a text Blob into an array of `FileItemChunk` objects, where each chunk contains a part of the text and the number of tokens in that part. This is useful for processing large text files in chunks, for example, when training a language model.
