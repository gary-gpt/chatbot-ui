# Code Documentation for `txt.ts`

This TypeScript file, `txt.ts`, is part of a chatbot user interface library. The primary function of this file is to process text files (`.txt`). The processing includes reading the text file, splitting it into chunks, and encoding each chunk. The result is an array of chunks, where each chunk is an object containing the chunk content and the number of tokens in the chunk.

## Import Statements

```ts
import { FileItemChunk } from "@/types"
import { encode } from "gpt-tokenizer"
import { RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter } from "langchain/text_splitter"
import { CHUNK_OVERLAP, CHUNK_SIZE } from "."
```

The import statements at the top of the file bring in the necessary modules and types that are used in the `processTxt` function. These include:

- `FileItemChunk` type from the local types module.
- `encode` function from the `gpt-tokenizer` module, which is used to tokenize the chunk content.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` class from the `langchain/text_splitter` module, which is used to split the text content into chunks.
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP` and `CHUNK_SIZE` constants from the local module.

## `processTxt` Function

```ts
export const processTxt = async (txt: Blob): Promise<FileItemChunk[]> => {
  // ...
}
```

The `processTxt` function is an asynchronous function that takes a Blob object (representing a .txt file) as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

### Reading the Text File

```ts
  const fileBuffer = Buffer.from(await txt.arrayBuffer())
  const textDecoder = new TextDecoder("utf-8")
  const textContent = textDecoder.decode(fileBuffer)
```

The function first reads the text file by converting the Blob object to an ArrayBuffer, then to a Buffer, and finally decoding the Buffer into a string using the `TextDecoder` object.

### Splitting the Text into Chunks

```ts
  const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
    chunkSize: CHUNK_SIZE,
    chunkOverlap: CHUNK_OVERLAP
  })
  const splitDocs = await splitter.createDocuments([textContent])
```

The function then splits the text content into chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` object. The chunk size and overlap are specified by the `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP` constants.

### Encoding the Chunks and Building the Result Array

```ts
  let chunks: FileItemChunk[] = []

  for (let i = 0; i < splitDocs.length; i++) {
    const doc = splitDocs[i]

    chunks.push({
      content: doc.pageContent,
      tokens: encode(doc.pageContent).length
    })
  }

  return chunks
```

Finally, the function encodes each chunk using the `encode` function from the `gpt-tokenizer` module and builds the result array. Each item in the array is an object containing the chunk content and the number of tokens in the chunk. The function then returns this array.
