# Documentation for `docx.ts`

The `docx.ts` file is a TypeScript module that exports a single function `processDocX`. This function is used to process a text string, split it into chunks, and return an array of chunks with their respective token counts. 

## Dependencies

This module imports several dependencies:

- `FileItemChunk` from "@/types": This is a custom type that represents a chunk of text and its token count.
- `encode` from "gpt-tokenizer": This is a function used to tokenize a string of text.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from "langchain/text_splitter": This is a class that is used to split a string of text into chunks.
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP`, `CHUNK_SIZE` from ".": These are constants that define the size of the chunks and the overlap between them.

## Function: `processDocX`

This function takes a string of text as input and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

```ts
export const processDocX = async (text: string): Promise<FileItemChunk[]> => {
  ...
}
```

### Parameters

- `text: string`: The input text to be processed.

### Return Value

A Promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects. Each `FileItemChunk` object contains the following properties:

- `content: string`: The chunk of text.
- `tokens: number`: The token count of the chunk.

### Logic

1. The function creates a new instance of `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP` as parameters.

```ts
  const splitter = new RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter({
    chunkSize: CHUNK_SIZE,
    chunkOverlap: CHUNK_OVERLAP
  })
```

2. It then uses the `createDocuments` method of the splitter to split the input text into chunks. This operation is asynchronous, so it uses the `await` keyword.

```ts
  const splitDocs = await splitter.createDocuments([text])
```

3. The function initializes an empty array `chunks` to store the `FileItemChunk` objects.

```ts
  let chunks: FileItemChunk[] = []
```

4. It then loops over the `splitDocs` array. For each document, it creates a new `FileItemChunk` object with the content of the document and the token count (obtained by calling the `encode` function on the content). This object is then pushed to the `chunks` array.

```ts
  for (let i = 0; i < splitDocs.length; i++) {
    const doc = splitDocs[i]

    chunks.push({
      content: doc.pageContent,
      tokens: encode(doc.pageContent).length
    })
  }
```

5. Finally, the function returns the `chunks` array.

```ts
  return chunks
```

This function is used to process a text string and split it into manageable chunks, each with its own token count. This is useful in scenarios where the text is too large to be processed at once, such as in a chatbot or a text analysis tool.
