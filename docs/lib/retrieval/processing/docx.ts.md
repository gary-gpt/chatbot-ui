# processDocX Function

This document provides a detailed overview of the `processDocX` function in the source code.

## Import Statements

The function imports the following modules and values:

- `FileItemChunk` from "@/types": This is a type that represents a chunk of a file item.
- `encode` from "gpt-tokenizer": This is a function used for tokenizing text.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from "langchain/text_splitter": This is a class used for splitting text into chunks.
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP` and `CHUNK_SIZE` from the current directory: These are constants that define the overlap and size of the chunks.

## Function Signature

```typescript
export const processDocX = async (text: string): Promise<FileItemChunk[]>
```

The `processDocX` function is an asynchronous function that takes a string as an argument and returns a promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

## Function Description

The `processDocX` function processes a given text by splitting it into chunks and encoding each chunk. The function creates a new instance of `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP` as parameters. It then uses this instance to split the input text into documents.

The function iterates over each document, encodes the content of the document, and pushes a new `FileItemChunk` object into the `chunks` array. Each `FileItemChunk` object contains the content of the document and the number of tokens in the content.

Finally, the function returns the `chunks` array.

## Example

```typescript
const text = "This is a sample text."
const chunks = await processDocX(text)
```

This will split the `text` into chunks, encode each chunk, and return an array of `FileItemChunk` objects. Each object will contain the content of a chunk and the number of tokens in the content.
