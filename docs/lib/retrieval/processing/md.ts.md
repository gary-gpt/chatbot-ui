# processMarkdown Function Documentation

## Overview

The `processMarkdown` function is an asynchronous function that processes a Markdown file and returns an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

## Import Statements

The function is part of a module that imports several dependencies:

- `FileItemChunk` from "@/types": This is a custom type that defines the structure of the chunks that the function will return.
- `encode` from "gpt-tokenizer": A function used to encode the content of each chunk.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from "langchain/text_splitter": A utility class for splitting text into chunks.
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP` and `CHUNK_SIZE` from ".": Constants that define the size of the chunks and the overlap between them.

## Parameters

The function takes one parameter:

- `markdown`: A Blob object representing the Markdown file to be processed.

## Return Value

The function returns a Promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects. Each `FileItemChunk` object has two properties:

- `content`: A string representing the content of the chunk.
- `tokens`: The number of tokens in the chunk, obtained by encoding the content.

## Function Flow

1. The function starts by converting the `markdown` Blob into a Buffer object.
2. It then creates a `TextDecoder` object to decode the Buffer into a UTF-8 string.
3. The function creates a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` object, specifying "markdown" as the language and using `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP` as the chunk size and overlap.
4. The function uses the splitter to split the text content into documents.
5. It then iterates over the documents, pushing a new `FileItemChunk` object for each document into the `chunks` array. The content of each chunk is the page content of the document, and the number of tokens is obtained by encoding the page content.
6. Finally, the function returns the `chunks` array.
