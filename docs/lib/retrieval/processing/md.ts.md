# Markdown Processing Module Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Markdown Processing Module located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/lib/retrieval/processing/md.ts`.

## Overview

The Markdown Processing Module is a TypeScript file that contains a single function, `processMarkdown`. This function takes a markdown file as input and processes it into chunks of text content and tokens.

## Dependencies

The module imports several dependencies:

- `FileItemChunk` from "@/types": This is a type definition for the chunk object.
- `encode` from "gpt-tokenizer": This is a function used to tokenize the text content.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from "langchain/text_splitter": This is a class used to split the text content into chunks.
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP`, `CHUNK_SIZE` from ".": These are constants that define the size and overlap of the chunks.

## Function: processMarkdown

```ts
export const processMarkdown = async (
  markdown: Blob
): Promise<FileItemChunk[]> => {
  ...
}
```

This function takes a markdown file as input and returns a promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects. Each `FileItemChunk` object contains the chunk content and the number of tokens in the chunk.

### Input

The function takes a single argument:

- `markdown`: A Blob object representing the markdown file to be processed.

### Output

The function returns a Promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects. Each `FileItemChunk` object has two properties:

- `content`: A string representing the chunk content.
- `tokens`: A number representing the number of tokens in the chunk.

### Logic

The function follows these steps:

1. It converts the markdown Blob into a Buffer and then decodes it into a string using the `TextDecoder` object.
2. It creates a `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` object and uses it to split the text content into chunks.
3. It iterates over the chunks and for each chunk, it creates a `FileItemChunk` object with the chunk content and the number of tokens in the chunk.
4. It returns the array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

## Code Summary

This module provides a function for processing markdown files into chunks of text content and tokens. It can be used in applications that need to process large markdown files in a way that is manageable and efficient.
