# TypeScript Configuration File

This file is a TypeScript configuration file for a Next.js project. It includes references to Next.js and Next.js image types.

## References

```typescript
/// <reference types="next" />
/// <reference types="next/image-types/global" />
```

These lines are directives to TypeScript to include type definitions from the specified packages. In this case, the types for `next` and `next/image-types/global` are being included.

- `next`: This is the core Next.js library. It includes types for all the built-in Next.js features like routing, server-side rendering, static site generation, and more.

- `next/image-types/global`: This is a part of Next.js that provides types for the new `next/image` feature. This feature allows you to optimize and load images in a Next.js application.

## Note

```typescript
// NOTE: This file should not be edited
// see https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript for more information.
```

This note indicates that this file should not be edited. The reason for this is that it is a configuration file that is meant to be managed by Next.js itself. Any changes you make to this file might be overwritten by Next.js in future updates.

For more information about using TypeScript with Next.js, refer to the [official Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript).
