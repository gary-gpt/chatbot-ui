# Sidebar Component

This file defines a `Sidebar` component for the application. The sidebar is a functional component that takes in two props: `contentType` and `showSidebar`.

## Imports

The file imports several dependencies:

- `ChatbotUIContext` from "@/context/context": This is the context object for the chatbot UI.
- `Tables` from "@/supabase/types": This is a type definition for the tables in the Supabase database.
- `ContentType` from "@/types": This is a type definition for the content types that can be displayed in the sidebar.
- `FC, useContext` from "react": These are React hooks for creating functional components and using context within them.
- `SIDEBAR_WIDTH` from "../ui/dashboard": This is a constant that defines the width of the sidebar.
- `TabsContent` from "../ui/tabs": This is a UI component for displaying tabbed content.
- `WorkspaceSwitcher` from "../utility/workspace-switcher": This is a utility component for switching between workspaces.
- `WorkspaceSettings` from "../workspace/workspace-settings": This is a component for displaying workspace settings.
- `SidebarContent` from "./sidebar-content": This is a component for displaying the content of the sidebar.

## Props

The `Sidebar` component takes in the following props:

- `contentType`: This is the type of content to be displayed in the sidebar. It is of type `ContentType`.
- `showSidebar`: This is a boolean that determines whether the sidebar should be displayed or not.

## Functionality

The `Sidebar` component uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to get the current state of the chatbot UI. It then filters the folders based on their type and displays the relevant content in the sidebar based on the `contentType` prop.

The `renderSidebarContent` function is used to render the `SidebarContent` component with the appropriate content and folders.

The sidebar's width is determined by the `showSidebar` prop and the `SIDEBAR_WIDTH` constant. If `showSidebar` is `true`, the sidebar's width is `SIDEBAR_WIDTH - 60px`. If `showSidebar` is `false`, the sidebar's width is `0px`.

The `WorkspaceSwitcher` and `WorkspaceSettings` components are displayed at the top of the sidebar.

The content of the sidebar is determined by a switch statement that checks the `contentType` prop and calls the `renderSidebarContent` function with the appropriate arguments.
