# Sidebar Search Component Documentation

This document explains the purpose and logic of the Sidebar Search component in a chatbot user interface. The file is located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/sidebar/sidebar-search.tsx`.

## Code Overview

The Sidebar Search component is a functional component written in TypeScript. It uses React's `FC` (Functional Component) type and is designed to provide a search input field in the sidebar of the chatbot UI. The search field allows users to search for specific content types.

## Import Statements

```ts
import { ContentType } from "@/types"
import { FC } from "react"
import { Input } from "../ui/input"
```

The code begins by importing necessary modules and types:

- `ContentType` is a custom type imported from the `@/types` directory. It represents the type of content that can be searched.
- `FC` (Functional Component) is a type from the `react` library, used for typing React functional components.
- `Input` is a custom UI component imported from the `../ui/input` directory. It represents an input field.

## Interface Definition

```ts
interface SidebarSearchProps {
  contentType: ContentType
  searchTerm: string
  setSearchTerm: Function
}
```

This interface defines the props that the SidebarSearch component expects:

- `contentType` is of type `ContentType` and represents the type of content that the user is searching for.
- `searchTerm` is a string that represents the current search term.
- `setSearchTerm` is a function that updates the search term.

## SidebarSearch Component

```ts
export const SidebarSearch: FC<SidebarSearchProps> = ({
  contentType,
  searchTerm,
  setSearchTerm
}) => {
  return (
    <Input
      placeholder={`Search ${contentType}...`}
      value={searchTerm}
      onChange={e => setSearchTerm(e.target.value)}
    />
  )
}
```

The SidebarSearch component is a functional component that returns an `Input` component. The `Input` component has three props:

- `placeholder` is a string that displays a placeholder text in the input field. It is dynamically set to "Search {contentType}...".
- `value` is set to the current `searchTerm`. This allows the input field to display the current search term.
- `onChange` is a function that updates the search term when the user types in the input field. It is set to a function that calls `setSearchTerm` with the new value of the input field.
