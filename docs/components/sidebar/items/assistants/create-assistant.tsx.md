# CreateAssistant Component

This is a React component for creating a new assistant.

## Props

- `isOpen`: A boolean indicating whether the component is open.
- `onOpenChange`: A function that handles changes to the `isOpen` state.

## Dependencies

This component depends on several other components and contexts:

- `SidebarCreateItem`: A component for creating a new item in the sidebar.
- `ChatSettingsForm`: A form component for setting chat settings.
- `ImagePicker`: A component for picking an image.
- `Input`: A basic input component.
- `Label`: A basic label component.
- `ChatbotUIContext`: The context for the chatbot UI.
- `AssistantRetrievalSelect`: A component for selecting retrieval items for the assistant.
- `AssistantToolSelect`: A component for selecting tools for the assistant.

## State

The component maintains several pieces of state:

- `name`: The name of the assistant.
- `isTyping`: A boolean indicating whether the user is currently typing.
- `description`: The description of the assistant.
- `assistantChatSettings`: The chat settings for the assistant.
- `selectedImage`: The selected image for the assistant.
- `imageLink`: The link to the selected image.
- `selectedAssistantRetrievalItems`: The selected retrieval items for the assistant.
- `selectedAssistantToolItems`: The selected tools for the assistant.

## Functionality

The component allows the user to create a new assistant, including setting its name, description, image, chat settings, retrieval items, and tools. The user's selections are stored in the component's state.

The component also checks whether the selected model is compatible with tools, and displays a message if it is not.

The `isOpen` prop controls whether the component is displayed, and the `onOpenChange` prop handles changes to this state.
