# SidebarDeleteItem Component

This file exports a single React functional component called `SidebarDeleteItem`.

## Props

The `SidebarDeleteItem` component takes the following props:

- `item`: An object of type `DataItemType`. This represents the item to be deleted.
- `contentType`: A string of type `ContentType`. This represents the type of the content to be deleted.

## Context

The `SidebarDeleteItem` component uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to get various state update functions.

## State

The component maintains a single piece of state:

- `showDialog`: A boolean that determines whether the delete confirmation dialog should be displayed.

## Functionality

The `SidebarDeleteItem` component provides a way to delete various types of content from the application. It uses a set of delete functions and state update functions, both of which are determined by the `contentType` prop.

When the delete button is clicked, the appropriate delete function is called, and then the state is updated to remove the deleted item.

## Component Structure

The component returns a `Dialog` component. The dialog is triggered by a `Button` with the text "Delete". The dialog content includes a header with the title "Delete {contentType.slice(0, -1)}" and a description asking for confirmation of the deletion. The dialog footer includes a "Cancel" button and a "Delete" button. The "Delete" button calls the `handleDelete` function when clicked.
