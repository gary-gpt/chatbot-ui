# Folder Component

This documentation provides details about the `Folder` component in the source code.

## Import Statements

The component imports various utilities, types, icons, and other components from different modules. This includes:

- Utility function `cn` from "@/lib/utils"
- Type `Tables` from "@/supabase/types"
- Type `ContentType` from "@/types"
- Icons `IconChevronDown`, `IconChevronRight` from "@tabler/icons-react"
- React hooks `FC`, `useRef`, `useState` from "react"
- Components `DeleteFolder`, `UpdateFolder` from the same directory

## Interface

The `FolderProps` interface is declared to type the props that the `Folder` component expects:

- `folder`: An object of type `Tables<"folders">`
- `contentType`: A `ContentType` object
- `children`: Any valid React node
- `onUpdateFolder`: A function that takes an `itemId` and `folderId` as arguments and returns `void`

## Component

The `Folder` component is a functional component that uses the `FolderProps` interface for its props. It maintains three pieces of state:

- `isDragOver`: A boolean indicating whether a drag operation is currently over the component
- `isExpanded`: A boolean indicating whether the folder is expanded or not
- `isHovering`: A boolean indicating whether the mouse is hovering over the component

The component also defines several event handlers for drag and drop operations, keyboard events, and mouse events.

## Rendered JSX

The component renders a `div` that acts as a container for the folder. This `div` has several event handlers attached to it for handling drag and drop operations, keyboard events, and mouse events.

Within this `div`, another `div` is rendered which displays the folder's name and icons for expanding/collapsing the folder. If the mouse is hovering over this `div`, additional icons for updating and deleting the folder are displayed.

If the folder is expanded, the children of the folder are rendered within another `div`.

## Usage

This component can be used in any part of the application where a folder-like structure is needed, with the ability to handle drag and drop operations, and update or delete folders. The `onUpdateFolder` prop should be passed a function that handles the updating of folders.
