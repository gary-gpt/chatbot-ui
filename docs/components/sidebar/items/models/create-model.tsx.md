# CreateModel Component

The `CreateModel` component is a functional component that provides an interface for creating a custom model. It uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to access the user's profile and selected workspace. If either of these are not available, the component will not render.

## Props

The component accepts the following props:

- `isOpen`: A boolean indicating whether the component is open.
- `onOpenChange`: A function that is called when the open state of the component changes. It accepts a boolean argument representing the new open state.

## State

The component maintains the following state variables:

- `isTyping`: A boolean indicating whether the user is currently typing.
- `apiKey`: A string representing the API key.
- `baseUrl`: A string representing the base URL.
- `description`: A string representing the description.
- `modelId`: A string representing the model ID.
- `name`: A string representing the name.
- `contextLength`: A number representing the context length. It defaults to 4096.

## Render

The component renders a `SidebarCreateItem` with the following props:

- `contentType`: Set to "models".
- `isOpen`: The current open state of the component.
- `isTyping`: The current typing state of the user.
- `onOpenChange`: The function to call when the open state changes.
- `createState`: An object representing the state of the new model to be created. It includes the user ID, API key, base URL, description, context length, model ID, and name.
- `renderInputs`: A function that returns a JSX element containing the input fields for the new model. This includes fields for the name, model ID, base URL, API key, and max context length.
