# DeleteChat Component

The `DeleteChat` component is a functional component that provides the functionality to delete a chat. It uses a dialog box to confirm the deletion of the chat.

## Props

The `DeleteChat` component accepts the following props:

- `chat`: An object of type `Tables<"chats">` which represents the chat to be deleted.

## Dependencies

- `useChatHandler`: A custom hook used to handle new chat creation.
- `Button`: A UI component for the button.
- `Dialog`, `DialogContent`, `DialogDescription`, `DialogFooter`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogTitle`, `DialogTrigger`: UI components for the dialog box.
- `ChatbotUIContext`: The context that provides the chatbot UI state.
- `deleteChat`: A function to delete a chat from the database.
- `useHotkey`: A custom hook to handle keyboard shortcuts.
- `Tables`: A type representing the database tables.
- `IconTrash`: An icon component for the trash icon.
- `FC`, `useContext`, `useRef`, `useState`: React hooks and types.

## Functionality

The `DeleteChat` component uses the `useHotkey` hook to listen for the 'Backspace' key press and show the delete chat dialog box. It uses the `useContext` hook to get the `setChats` function from the `ChatbotUIContext`.

The `handleDeleteChat` function is an asynchronous function that deletes the chat from the database, updates the chats state by filtering out the deleted chat, hides the delete chat dialog box, and handles the creation of a new chat.

The `handleKeyDown` function listens for the 'Enter' key press and triggers a click event on the delete button.

## Rendering

The `DeleteChat` component renders a dialog box with a trash icon as the trigger. The dialog box includes a header with the title and description, and a footer with 'Cancel' and 'Delete' buttons. The 'Cancel' button hides the dialog box, and the 'Delete' button triggers the `handleDeleteChat` function. The dialog box listens for the 'Enter' key press and triggers a click event on the delete button.
