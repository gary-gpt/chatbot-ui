# UpdateChat Component

This component is used to update the details of a chat. It provides a dialog box where the user can edit the name of the chat.

## Import Statements

```jsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogContent,
  DialogFooter,
  DialogHeader,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger
} from "@/components/ui/dialog"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label"
import { ChatbotUIContext } from "@/context/context"
import { updateChat } from "@/db/chats"
import { Tables } from "@/supabase/types"
import { IconEdit } from "@tabler/icons-react"
import { FC, useContext, useRef, useState } from "react"
```

## Props

The `UpdateChat` component takes the following props:

- `chat`: An object of type `Tables<"chats">` which represents the chat to be updated.

## State Variables

- `showChatDialog`: A boolean value that determines whether the dialog box is visible or not.
- `name`: A string that represents the name of the chat.

## Functions

- `handleUpdateChat`: This function is triggered when the save button is clicked. It updates the chat with the new name and updates the state of the chats.
- `handleKeyDown`: This function is triggered when a key is pressed. If the enter key is pressed, it triggers a click event on the save button.

## Return

The component returns a `Dialog` component that contains a form to edit the name of the chat. The dialog box contains an `IconEdit` button that opens the dialog box when clicked. Inside the dialog box, there is an `Input` field for the name of the chat and two `Button` components for canceling and saving the changes. 

The save button triggers the `handleUpdateChat` function when clicked, and the cancel button hides the dialog box. The `handleKeyDown` function is also attached to the `DialogContent` component to allow the user to save the changes by pressing the enter key.
