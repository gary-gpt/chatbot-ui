# Create Collection Component Documentation

This document provides an overview of the `CreateCollection` component, which is located in the file `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/sidebar/items/collections/create-collection.tsx`. The `CreateCollection` component is a functional component in React that allows users to create a new collection of files.

## Imports

The component imports several other components and contexts, as well as some constants and types:

- `SidebarCreateItem`: A component that provides a UI for creating new items in the sidebar.
- `Input` and `Label`: UI components for user inputs and labels.
- `ChatbotUIContext`: The context that provides data and functions related to the chatbot UI.
- `COLLECTION_DESCRIPTION_MAX` and `COLLECTION_NAME_MAX`: Constants that define the maximum lengths for the collection name and description.
- `TablesInsert`: A type that represents a new row to be inserted into a table.
- `CollectionFile`: A type that represents a file in a collection.
- `CollectionFileSelect`: A component that allows users to select files for the collection.

## Props

The `CreateCollection` component accepts the following props:

- `isOpen`: A boolean that indicates whether the component is currently open.
- `onOpenChange`: A function that is called when the open state of the component changes.

## State

The component maintains several pieces of state:

- `name`: The name of the new collection.
- `isTyping`: A boolean that indicates whether the user is currently typing.
- `description`: The description of the new collection.
- `selectedCollectionFiles`: An array of the files that have been selected for the new collection.

## Functionality

The component provides a UI for creating a new collection. It allows users to select files for the collection, and to enter a name and description for the collection. The selected files, name, and description are all stored in the component's state.

The component also provides a function `handleFileSelect` for handling the selection of files. This function updates the `selectedCollectionFiles` state based on the file that was selected.

## Rendering

The component renders a `SidebarCreateItem` with the `contentType` set to "collections". It passes the current state and props to the `SidebarCreateItem`, as well as a `renderInputs` function that renders the inputs for selecting files and entering the collection name and description.

If the `profile` or `selectedWorkspace` is not available from the `ChatbotUIContext`, the component renders `null`.

## Code

Here is the complete code for the `CreateCollection` component:

```ts
// Import necessary components, contexts, constants, and types
// ...

// Define the props for the CreateCollection component
interface CreateCollectionProps {
  isOpen: boolean
  onOpenChange: (isOpen: boolean) => void
}

// Define the CreateCollection component
export const CreateCollection: FC<CreateCollectionProps> = ({
  isOpen,
  onOpenChange
}) => {
  // Get the profile and selectedWorkspace from the ChatbotUIContext
  // ...

  // Initialize the state for the component
  // ...

  // Define the handleFileSelect function
  // ...

  // If the profile or selectedWorkspace is not available, render null
  if (!profile) return null
  if (!selectedWorkspace) return null

  // Render the SidebarCreateItem with the necessary props and state
  return (
    // ...
  )
}
```
