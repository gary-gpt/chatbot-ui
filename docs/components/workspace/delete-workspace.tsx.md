# DeleteWorkspace Component

This is a React component that provides a user interface for deleting a workspace. It is a part of a chatbot application.

## Props

The `DeleteWorkspace` component takes the following props:

- `workspace`: An object representing the workspace to be deleted. It should adhere to the `Tables<"workspaces">` interface.
- `onDelete`: A callback function that is called after the workspace is successfully deleted.

## Functionality

The `DeleteWorkspace` component uses several hooks and context:

- `useContext(ChatbotUIContext)`: This hook is used to get the `setWorkspaces` and `setSelectedWorkspace` functions from the `ChatbotUIContext`.
- `useChatHandler()`: This hook is used to get the `handleNewChat` function which is called after a workspace is deleted.
- `useRouter()`: This hook from `next/navigation` is used to navigate to the default workspace after the current one is deleted.

The component maintains two pieces of state:

- `showWorkspaceDialog`: A boolean indicating whether the delete workspace dialog is currently open.
- `name`: A string representing the name of the workspace to be deleted. This is used to confirm the deletion.

The component renders a `Dialog` component which contains a delete button, a warning message, an input field for the user to confirm the deletion by typing the name of the workspace, and a delete button to confirm the deletion.

## Event Handlers

- `handleDeleteWorkspace`: This async function is called when the delete button is clicked. It deletes the workspace from the database, updates the workspaces state, navigates to the default workspace, and calls the `onDelete` prop.
- `handleKeyDown`: This function is called when a key is pressed in the dialog content. If the key is "Enter", it simulates a click on the delete button.

## Styling

The component uses the `Button`, `Dialog`, `DialogContent`, `DialogDescription`, `DialogFooter`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogTitle`, `DialogTrigger`, and `Input` components from the UI library for styling.
