# AnthropicSVG Component Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `AnthropicSVG` component found in the file `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/icons/anthropic-svg.tsx`.

## Overview

The `AnthropicSVG` component is a React Functional Component (FC) that renders an SVG icon. This icon can be customized with different sizes and CSS classes through its props.

## Code Breakdown

### Imports

```ts
import { FC } from "react"
```

The `FC` (Functional Component) type from the `react` library is imported. This is used to type the `AnthropicSVG` component.

### Interface

```ts
interface AnthropicSVGProps {
  height?: number
  width?: number
  className?: string
}
```

An interface `AnthropicSVGProps` is declared to define the props that the `AnthropicSVG` component accepts. It can accept `height`, `width`, and `className` props. All of these props are optional.

- `height`: This prop can be used to set the height of the SVG icon.
- `width`: This prop can be used to set the width of the SVG icon.
- `className`: This prop can be used to apply CSS classes to the SVG icon.

### Component

```ts
export const AnthropicSVG: FC<AnthropicSVGProps> = ({
  height = 40,
  width = 40,
  className
}) => {
  // SVG code here
}
```

The `AnthropicSVG` component is declared and exported. It is typed as a Functional Component that accepts props of type `AnthropicSVGProps`. Default values are provided for `height` and `width` props. If these props are not passed when the component is used, they will default to `40`.

The component returns an SVG element with two groups of paths. The `className`, `height`, and `width` props are used to set the corresponding attributes of the SVG element. The `viewBox` and `overflow` attributes are hardcoded.

## Usage

To use this component, import it from its file and use it in your JSX like any other component. You can pass `height`, `width`, and `className` props to customize the SVG icon.

```jsx
import { AnthropicSVG } from "/path/to/anthropic-svg"

// In your component's render method
<AnthropicSVG height={50} width={50} className="my-custom-class" />
```

This will render the `AnthropicSVG` icon with a height and width of `50` and with the CSS class `my-custom-class`.
