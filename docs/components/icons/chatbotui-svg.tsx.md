# Chatbot User Interface SVG Component

This document explains the purpose and logic of the `ChatbotUISVG` component in the file `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/icons/chatbotui-svg.tsx`.

## Overview

The `ChatbotUISVG` component is a React Functional Component (FC) that renders an SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image. This SVG image is used as an icon for a chatbot user interface. The component allows for theming (dark or light) and scaling.

## Code Explanation

### Importing Dependencies

```ts
import { FC } from "react"
```
The `FC` (Functional Component) type from the `react` library is imported. This type is used to type-check our component and its props.

### Defining the Props Interface

```ts
interface ChatbotUISVGProps {
  theme: "dark" | "light"
  scale?: number
}
```
An interface `ChatbotUISVGProps` is defined to type-check the props that the `ChatbotUISVG` component will accept. The `theme` prop is a string that can either be "dark" or "light", and the `scale` prop is an optional number.

### The ChatbotUISVG Component

```ts
export const ChatbotUISVG: FC<ChatbotUISVGProps> = ({ theme, scale = 1 }) => {
  ...
}
```
The `ChatbotUISVG` component is declared as a functional component that accepts props of type `ChatbotUISVGProps`. The `theme` and `scale` props are destructured from the props object. If `scale` is not provided, it defaults to 1.

### The SVG Element

The SVG element is rendered with its width and height scaled according to the `scale` prop. The `viewBox` attribute is set to "0 0 189 194" to specify the aspect ratio and coordinate system of the SVG. The `fill` attribute is set to "none", and the `xmlns` attribute is set to "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", which is the XML namespace for SVG elements.

### The SVG Paths

The SVG contains three paths: a rectangle and two custom paths. The `fill` and `stroke` colors of these paths are determined by the `theme` prop. If `theme` is "dark", the `fill` color is black ("#000") and the `stroke` color is white ("#fff"). If `theme` is "light", the `fill` color is white ("#fff") and the `stroke` color is black ("#000"). The `strokeWidth` of the rectangle is set to 25. The `d` attributes of the custom paths define their shapes.
