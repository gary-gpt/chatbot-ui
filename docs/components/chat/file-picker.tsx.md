# FilePicker Component

This is a documentation for the `FilePicker` component in React.

## Import Dependencies

The `FilePicker` component imports several dependencies:

- `ChatbotUIContext` from "@/context/context"
- `Tables` from "@/supabase/types"
- `IconBooks` from "@tabler/icons-react"
- `FC, useContext, useEffect, useRef` from "react"
- `FileIcon` from "../ui/file-icon"

## Props

The `FilePicker` component receives the following props:

- `isOpen`: A boolean indicating if the file picker is open.
- `searchQuery`: A string for the search query.
- `onOpenChange`: A function to handle the change of the open state.
- `selectedFileIds`: An array of selected file IDs.
- `selectedCollectionIds`: An array of selected collection IDs.
- `onSelectFile`: A function to handle the selection of a file.
- `onSelectCollection`: A function to handle the selection of a collection.
- `isFocused`: A boolean indicating if the file picker is focused.

## Component Functionality

The `FilePicker` component uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to get the files and collections. It also uses a ref to keep track of the items in the file picker.

The component filters the files and collections based on the search query and whether they have been selected.

The `handleOpenChange` function is used to handle the change of the open state of the file picker.

The `handleSelectFile` and `handleSelectCollection` functions are used to handle the selection of a file or a collection and then close the file picker.

The `getKeyDownHandler` function is used to handle key down events. It handles the "Escape", "Backspace", "Enter", "Tab", "ArrowDown", and "ArrowUp" keys.

The component returns a div that displays the filtered files and collections. Each file or collection is displayed with an icon and its name and description. The user can select a file or collection by clicking on it or by using the "Enter" key.

## Styles

The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The file picker is displayed as a flex container with a background, rounded corners, a border, and padding. The files and collections are displayed as flex items with hover and focus styles.
