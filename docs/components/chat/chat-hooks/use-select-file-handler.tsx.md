# Documentation

This file contains the `useSelectFileHandler` hook which is used for handling file selection in the chatbot UI.

## Imports

- `ChatbotUIContext` from "@/context/context": This is the context object for the chatbot UI.
- `createDocXFile`, `createFile` from "@/db/files": These are functions for creating files in the database.
- `LLM_LIST` from "@/lib/models/llm/llm-list": This is a list of LLM models.
- `mammoth`: This is a library for handling .docx files.
- `useContext`, `useEffect`, `useState` from "react": These are React hooks.
- `toast` from "sonner": This is a library for displaying toast notifications.

## Constants

- `ACCEPTED_FILE_TYPES`: This is a list of accepted file types for the chatbot UI.

## Hook: useSelectFileHandler

This hook returns an object with two properties: `handleSelectDeviceFile` and `filesToAccept`.

### handleSelectDeviceFile

This is an async function that handles the selection of a file from the device. It takes a `File` object as a parameter. It checks if the file type is supported, reads the file content, and creates a new file in the database.

### filesToAccept

This is a state variable that holds the list of file types that the chatbot UI should accept. It is initially set to `ACCEPTED_FILE_TYPES` and is updated based on the `chatSettings` context.

## Context: ChatbotUIContext

This context provides several state variables and setters related to the chatbot UI, including:

- `selectedWorkspace`
- `profile`
- `chatSettings`
- `setNewMessageImages`
- `setNewMessageFiles`
- `setShowFilesDisplay`
- `setFiles`
- `setUseRetrieval`

## Dependencies

This hook has a dependency on `chatSettings?.model`. Whenever this value changes, it calls `handleFilesToAccept` to update the `filesToAccept` state.

## Error Handling

If an unsupported file type is selected, an error is thrown. If there is an error while reading the file content or creating the file in the database, a toast notification is displayed and the temporary file/image is removed from the state.
