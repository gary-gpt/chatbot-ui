# use-select-file-handler.tsx

This TypeScript file is a custom React hook that handles the selection and processing of files within a chatbot UI. It accepts a variety of file types, including CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, plain text, and Word documents, and handles them differently based on their type. It also provides functionality for handling image files.

## Import Statements

The file begins by importing necessary dependencies and context.

```ts
import { ChatbotUIContext } from "@/context/context"
import { createDocXFile, createFile } from "@/db/files"
import { LLM_LIST } from "@/lib/models/llm/llm-list"
import mammoth from "mammoth"
import { useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react"
import { toast } from "sonner"
```

## Accepted File Types

The `ACCEPTED_FILE_TYPES` constant is an array of MIME types that the chatbot UI can handle. It is exported so it can be used in other parts of the application.

```ts
export const ACCEPTED_FILE_TYPES = [
  "text/csv",
  "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document",
  "application/json",
  "text/markdown",
  "application/pdf",
  "text/plain"
].join(",")
```

## useSelectFileHandler Hook

The `useSelectFileHandler` hook is the main export of this file. It provides the functionality to handle the selection of a file from the user's device.

```ts
export const useSelectFileHandler = () => {
  ...
}
```

### Context and State

The hook uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to access various pieces of state and functions from the context. It also sets up local state for `filesToAccept` using the `useState` hook.

```ts
const {
  selectedWorkspace,
  profile,
  chatSettings,
  setNewMessageImages,
  setNewMessageFiles,
  setShowFilesDisplay,
  setFiles,
  setUseRetrieval
} = useContext(ChatbotUIContext)

const [filesToAccept, setFilesToAccept] = useState(ACCEPTED_FILE_TYPES)
```

### useEffect Hook

The `useEffect` hook is used to call the `handleFilesToAccept` function whenever the `chatSettings?.model` changes.

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  handleFilesToAccept()
}, [chatSettings?.model])
```

### handleFilesToAccept Function

The `handleFilesToAccept` function checks if the current model allows for image input. If it does, it updates `filesToAccept` to include image MIME types.

```ts
const handleFilesToAccept = () => {
  ...
}
```

### handleSelectDeviceFile Function

The `handleSelectDeviceFile` function is the main function of this hook. It handles the selection of a file from the user's device, reading the file as necessary based on its type, and creating a new file or image message as appropriate.

```ts
const handleSelectDeviceFile = async (file: File) => {
  ...
}
```

## Return Statement

The `useSelectFileHandler` hook returns an object containing the `handleSelectDeviceFile` function and the `filesToAccept` state.

```ts
return {
  handleSelectDeviceFile,
  filesToAccept
}
```

This allows these items to be used in the component that calls this hook.
