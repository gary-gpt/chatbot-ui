# Progress Component Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `Progress` component found in the file `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/ui/progress.tsx`.

## Overview

The `Progress` component is a UI component that displays a progress bar. It is built using the `@radix-ui/react-progress` library, a part of the Radix UI primitive collection. The progress bar is customizable through the `className` and `value` props.

## Code Breakdown

```ts
"use client"
```
This line indicates that the code is intended to run on the client-side.

```ts
import * as React from "react"
import * as ProgressPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-progress"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
```
These lines import the necessary dependencies. `React` is the JavaScript library used for building the UI. `ProgressPrimitive` is the Radix UI primitive for creating progress bars. `cn` is a utility function for handling class names.

```ts
const Progress = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof ProgressPrimitive.Root>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof ProgressPrimitive.Root>
>(({ className, value, ...props }, ref) => (
```
This part of the code defines the `Progress` component using `React.forwardRef`. This allows the component to accept a `ref` prop and pass it to the `ProgressPrimitive.Root` component. The `Progress` component also accepts `className` and `value` props.

```ts
  <ProgressPrimitive.Root
    ref={ref}
    className={cn(
      "bg-secondary relative h-4 w-full overflow-hidden rounded-full",
      className
    )}
    {...props}
  >
```
This is the root element of the progress bar. It has a `ref` prop and a `className` prop. The `className` prop is used to apply CSS classes to the progress bar. The `cn` function combines the default classes with any additional classes passed in through the `className` prop. The `...props` syntax spreads in any other props passed to the `Progress` component.

```ts
    <ProgressPrimitive.Indicator
      className="bg-primary size-full flex-1 transition-all"
      style={{ transform: `translateX(-${100 - (value || 0)}%)` }}
    />
```
This is the indicator element of the progress bar. It has a `className` prop and a `style` prop. The `style` prop is used to control the position of the indicator based on the `value` prop. The `value` prop represents the current progress as a percentage.

```ts
  </ProgressPrimitive.Root>
))
Progress.displayName = ProgressPrimitive.Root.displayName
```
This closes the `ProgressPrimitive.Root` component. The `displayName` of `Progress` is then set to the `displayName` of `ProgressPrimitive.Root`.

```ts
export { Progress }
```
Finally, the `Progress` component is exported for use in other parts of the application.

## Usage

The `Progress` component can be used in other parts of the application like this:

```ts
import { Progress } from '@/components/ui/progress'

<Progress value={50} />
```

This will render a progress bar that is 50% complete.
