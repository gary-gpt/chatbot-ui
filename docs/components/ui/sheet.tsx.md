# Documentation for `sheet.tsx`

This TypeScript file defines and exports a set of UI components for a chatbot interface. These components are built on top of the `@radix-ui/react-dialog` primitives and are styled using Tailwind CSS classes.

## Imports

The file imports several modules:

- `@radix-ui/react-dialog`: A set of unstyled, customizable and accessible dialog components.
- `class-variance-authority`: A utility for creating variant classes.
- `react`: The React library.
- `@/lib/utils`: A custom utility library, which includes the `cn` function for class name concatenation.

## Components

The file defines several components:

### Sheet

This is the root component for the dialog. It is directly imported from `@radix-ui/react-dialog`.

### SheetTrigger

This component is used to trigger the opening of the dialog.

### SheetClose

This component is used to close the dialog.

### SheetPortal

This component is used to render the dialog into a React Portal.

### SheetOverlay

This component is used to create an overlay behind the dialog. It is styled with a semi-transparent background and a blur effect.

### SheetContent

This component is used to display the content of the dialog. It uses the `sheetVariants` utility to apply different styles based on the `side` prop.

### SheetHeader

This component is used to display the header of the dialog.

### SheetFooter

This component is used to display the footer of the dialog.

### SheetTitle

This component is used to display the title of the dialog.

### SheetDescription

This component is used to display the description of the dialog.

## Exports

The file exports all of the above components for use in other parts of the application.

## Code Summaries

Below are summaries of key parts of the code:

### sheetVariants

This utility uses the `cva` function from `class-variance-authority` to define a set of variant classes for the `SheetContent` component. The variants are based on the `side` prop and define different slide-in and slide-out animations.

### SheetContentProps

This interface extends the props of the `SheetPrimitive.Content` component and adds the `VariantProps` of the `sheetVariants`.

### SheetContent

This component uses the `SheetPortal` and `SheetOverlay` components to create a modal dialog with an overlay. The content of the dialog is rendered inside the `SheetPrimitive.Content` component.

### SheetHeader, SheetFooter, SheetTitle, SheetDescription

These components are simple wrappers around HTML elements, with some additional styling. They are used to structure the content of the dialog.

## Comments

The file includes a commented-out section inside the `SheetContent` component, which seems to be an alternative way of rendering the close button.
