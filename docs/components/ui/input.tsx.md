# Input Component Documentation

This file is located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/ui/input.tsx`. It exports a reusable Input component for use in a React application.

## Import Statements

```ts
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
```

The file begins by importing the necessary dependencies. It imports the entire React library and a utility function `cn` from a local file.

## InputProps Interface

```ts
export interface InputProps extends React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement> {}
```

The `InputProps` interface is defined to type check the props that the Input component will receive. It extends the `InputHTMLAttributes` interface from React, which includes all the standard attributes that an input HTML element can have.

## Input Component

```ts
const Input = React.forwardRef<HTMLInputElement, InputProps>(
  ({ className, type, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <input
        type={type}
        className={cn(
          "border-input bg-background ring-offset-background placeholder:text-muted-foreground focus:none flex h-10 w-full rounded-md border px-3 py-2 text-sm file:border-0 file:bg-transparent file:text-sm file:font-medium focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:cursor-not-allowed disabled:opacity-50",
          className
        )}
        ref={ref}
        {...props}
      />
    )
  }
)
```

The `Input` component is a functional component that uses the `forwardRef` function from React to pass a `ref` through. This is useful when you need to access the DOM node directly in a parent component. 

The component destructures `className`, `type`, and `props` from the props it receives. The `className` and `type` are used directly on the input element, while the rest of the props (`...props`) are spread onto the input element.

The `className` prop is combined with a string of predefined classes using the `cn` utility function. This allows the component to have a consistent base styling while also accepting additional classes from its parent component.

## Display Name

```ts
Input.displayName = "Input"
```

The `displayName` string is used in debugging messages. Here, it's set to `"Input"`.

## Export Statement

```ts
export { Input }
```

Finally, the `Input` component is exported for use in other parts of the application.
