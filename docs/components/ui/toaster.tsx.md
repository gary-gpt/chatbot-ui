# Toaster Component Documentation

This markdown file documents the `Toaster` component located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/ui/toaster.tsx`.

## Overview

The `Toaster` component is responsible for displaying toast notifications in the application. It uses the `useToast` hook to get the list of toasts to display and renders them within a `ToastProvider` component.

## Code Breakdown

```ts
"use client"
```
This line indicates that the code is meant to be run on the client side.

```ts
import {
  Toast,
  ToastClose,
  ToastDescription,
  ToastProvider,
  ToastTitle,
  ToastViewport
} from "@/components/ui/toast"

import { useToast } from "@/components/ui/use-toast"
```
These lines import the necessary components and hooks from the application's UI library. The `Toast` related components are used to structure and style the toast notifications. The `useToast` hook is used to fetch the list of toasts to display.

```ts
export function Toaster() {
  const { toasts } = useToast()
```
The `Toaster` function component is declared and the `useToast` hook is called within it. The `toasts` object is destructured from the result of the `useToast` hook. This object contains an array of toast notifications to display.

```ts
return (
    <ToastProvider>
      {toasts.map(function ({ id, title, description, action, ...props }) {
        return (
          <Toast key={id} {...props}>
            <div className="grid gap-1">
              {title && <ToastTitle>{title}</ToastTitle>}
              {description && (
                <ToastDescription>{description}</ToastDescription>
              )}
            </div>
            {action}
            <ToastClose />
          </Toast>
        )
      })}
      <ToastViewport />
    </ToastProvider>
  )
```
The `Toaster` component returns a `ToastProvider` component. Inside the `ToastProvider`, it maps over the `toasts` array and for each toast, it returns a `Toast` component. 

Each `Toast` component is given a unique `key` prop (the `id` of the toast) and any additional props (`...props`). Inside the `Toast` component, a `div` with the class `grid gap-1` is used to structure the content. 

If the toast has a `title`, a `ToastTitle` component is rendered with the `title` as its children. If the toast has a `description`, a `ToastDescription` component is rendered with the `description` as its children. 

If the toast has an `action`, it is rendered as is. Finally, a `ToastClose` component is rendered which presumably provides a way for users to close the toast notification.

After the `toasts` array is mapped over, a `ToastViewport` component is rendered. This component likely provides a viewport for the toast notifications to be displayed in.
