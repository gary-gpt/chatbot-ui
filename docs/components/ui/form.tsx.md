# Form Component

This file exports several components and hooks related to form handling, including `Form`, `FormItem`, `FormLabel`, `FormControl`, `FormDescription`, `FormMessage`, `FormField`, and `useFormField`.

## Form

The `Form` component is a wrapper for the `FormProvider` from `react-hook-form`. It doesn't add any additional functionality or props.

## FormField

The `FormField` component is a wrapper for the `Controller` component from `react-hook-form`. It provides a context that includes the name of the field.

## useFormField

The `useFormField` hook is a custom hook that provides several pieces of information related to a form field. It should be used within a `FormField` component.

## FormItem

The `FormItem` component is a `div` element that provides a context with a unique `id`. This `id` is used to generate other ids for form-related elements.

## FormLabel

The `FormLabel` component is a wrapper for the `Label` component. It uses the `useFormField` hook to determine if the associated form field has an error, and if so, it applies the `text-destructive` class.

## FormControl

The `FormControl` component is a wrapper for the `Slot` component from `@radix-ui/react-slot`. It uses the `useFormField` hook to set several `aria-` attributes related to accessibility.

## FormDescription

The `FormDescription` component is a `p` element that displays a description for a form field. It uses the `useFormField` hook to set its `id`.

## FormMessage

The `FormMessage` component is a `p` element that displays a message for a form field. It uses the `useFormField` hook to determine if the associated form field has an error, and if so, it displays the error message. If there is no error, it displays its children.
