# Collapsible Component Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `collapsible.tsx` file located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/ui/collapsible.tsx`. This file is a part of the UI components for a chatbot application and it specifically deals with the collapsible elements in the UI.

## Code Overview

The code is written in TypeScript and it uses the `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` package to import the necessary components for creating collapsible elements in the UI. The main components imported from this package are `Root`, `CollapsibleTrigger`, and `CollapsibleContent`.

Here is a brief summary of each component:

- `Root`: This is the main component that wraps the collapsible section.
- `CollapsibleTrigger`: This component is used to create a trigger that can open or close the collapsible section.
- `CollapsibleContent`: This component is used to wrap the content that will be shown or hidden when the collapsible section is opened or closed.

These components are then re-exported for use in other parts of the application.

## Detailed Code Breakdown

```ts
"use client"
```

This line indicates that the code is intended to be run on the client side.

```ts
import * as CollapsiblePrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-collapsible"
```

This line imports all the components from the `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` package and assigns them to the `CollapsiblePrimitive` object.

```ts
const Collapsible = CollapsiblePrimitive.Root
```

This line creates a new constant `Collapsible` and assigns it the `Root` component from the `CollapsiblePrimitive` object.

```ts
const CollapsibleTrigger = CollapsiblePrimitive.CollapsibleTrigger
```

This line creates a new constant `CollapsibleTrigger` and assigns it the `CollapsibleTrigger` component from the `CollapsiblePrimitive` object.

```ts
const CollapsibleContent = CollapsiblePrimitive.CollapsibleContent
```

This line creates a new constant `CollapsibleContent` and assigns it the `CollapsibleContent` component from the `CollapsiblePrimitive` object.

```ts
export { Collapsible, CollapsibleTrigger, CollapsibleContent }
```

Finally, this line exports the `Collapsible`, `CollapsibleTrigger`, and `CollapsibleContent` constants so they can be used in other parts of the application.
