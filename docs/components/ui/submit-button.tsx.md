# Submit Button Component Documentation

This file is located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/ui/submit-button.tsx`. It exports a `SubmitButton` component which is a specialized version of a generic `Button` component. The `SubmitButton` is disabled when a form submission is pending.

## Code Overview

```ts
"use client"

import React from "react"
import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom"
import { Button, ButtonProps } from "./button"

const SubmitButton = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  (props, ref) => {
    const { pending } = useFormStatus()

    return <Button disabled={pending} ref={ref} {...props} />
  }
)

SubmitButton.displayName = "SubmitButton"

export { SubmitButton }
```

## Detailed Breakdown

### Import Statements

```ts
import React from "react"
import { useFormStatus } from "react-dom"
import { Button, ButtonProps } from "./button"
```

The code begins by importing necessary modules. It imports `React` from the 'react' package, `useFormStatus` from 'react-dom' package, and `Button` and `ButtonProps` from the local 'button' module.

### SubmitButton Component

```ts
const SubmitButton = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  (props, ref) => {
    const { pending } = useFormStatus()

    return <Button disabled={pending} ref={ref} {...props} />
  }
)
```

The `SubmitButton` component is defined using `React.forwardRef`. This allows the component to accept a `ref` prop and pass it to the `Button` component. This can be useful for managing focus, text selection, or media playback.

The `SubmitButton` component uses the `useFormStatus` hook to check if a form submission is pending. If a submission is pending, the button is disabled.

### Display Name

```ts
SubmitButton.displayName = "SubmitButton"
```

The `displayName` string is used in debugging messages. It's helpful to set this property to help identify the component in React Developer Tools and other debugging utilities.

### Export Statement

```ts
export { SubmitButton }
```

Finally, the `SubmitButton` component is exported for use in other modules.
