# TextareaAutosize Component

This is a React functional component that uses the `react-textarea-autosize` library to create a textarea input field that automatically adjusts its height based on the content.

## Props

The component accepts the following props:

- `value` (string): The current value of the textarea. This is a controlled component, so the value is required.

- `onValueChange` (function): A callback function that is called when the value of the textarea changes. It receives the new value as an argument.

- `textareaRef` (React.RefObject<HTMLTextAreaElement>, optional): A ref object that can be used to access the underlying textarea element.

- `className` (string, optional): Additional CSS classes to apply to the textarea.

- `placeholder` (string, optional): A placeholder text to display when the textarea is empty. Defaults to an empty string.

- `minRows` (number, optional): The minimum number of rows the textarea should have. Defaults to 1.

- `maxRows` (number, optional): The maximum number of rows the textarea can expand to. Defaults to 6.

- `maxLength` (number, optional): The maximum number of characters that can be entered into the textarea.

- `onKeyDown` (function, optional): A callback function that is called when a key is pressed down in the textarea. It receives the keyboard event as an argument.

- `onPaste` (function, optional): A callback function that is called when text is pasted into the textarea. It receives the clipboard event as an argument.

- `onCompositionStart` (function, optional): A callback function that is called when the composition of a character sequence has begun in the textarea. It receives the composition event as an argument.

- `onCompositionEnd` (function, optional): A callback function that is called when the composition of a character sequence has ended in the textarea. It receives the composition event as an argument.

## Usage

Here is an example of how to use the `TextareaAutosize` component:

```jsx
import { TextareaAutosize } from './TextareaAutosize';

function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = React.useState('');

  return (
    <TextareaAutosize
      value={value}
      onValueChange={setValue}
      placeholder="Enter some text..."
    />
  );
}
```

In this example, the `TextareaAutosize` component is controlled by the `value` state variable. When the value of the textarea changes, the `setValue` function is called to update the state.
