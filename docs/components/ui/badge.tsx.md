# Badge Component Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the `Badge` component in the source code.

## Importing Dependencies

The `Badge` component relies on the following dependencies:

- `React` from the `react` library.
- `cva` and `type VariantProps` from the `class-variance-authority` library.
- `cn` from the `@/lib/utils` library.

## Badge Variants

`badgeVariants` is a constant that uses the `cva` function to define different styles for the `Badge` component. It includes four variants: `default`, `secondary`, `destructive`, and `outline`.

## BadgeProps Interface

The `BadgeProps` interface extends the `React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>` and `VariantProps<typeof badgeVariants>` interfaces. This means that the `Badge` component can accept any properties that a standard HTML div element can, in addition to the properties defined in `VariantProps`.

## Badge Function Component

The `Badge` function component accepts an object of `BadgeProps` as its argument. It returns a div element with a class name generated by the `cn` function and `badgeVariants` function, and spreads the remaining properties onto the div.

## Exports

The `Badge` function component and `badgeVariants` constant are exported from this file.

## Usage

To use the `Badge` component, import it into your file and pass in the desired properties. The `variant` property can be used to specify the style of the badge. If no `variant` is provided, the `default` style will be used.

```jsx
import { Badge } from './Badge';

<Badge variant="secondary">Example</Badge>
```

This will render a badge with the `secondary` style.
