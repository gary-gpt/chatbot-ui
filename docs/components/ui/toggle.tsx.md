# Toggle Component Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `Toggle` component found in the source code.

## Import Statements

The following packages and files are imported:

- `React` from the `react` package.
- `TogglePrimitive` from the `@radix-ui/react-toggle` package.
- `cva` and `VariantProps` from the `class-variance-authority` package.
- `cn` from the `utils` file in the `lib` directory.

## Toggle Variants

The `toggleVariants` constant is a function that accepts a string of CSS classes and an object. The object contains two properties: `variants` and `defaultVariants`.

The `variants` property is an object that defines two types of variants: `variant` and `size`. Each type of variant has a `default` value and other possible values. 

The `defaultVariants` property is an object that sets the default values for the `variant` and `size` variants.

## Toggle Component

The `Toggle` component is a forward-ref React component. It accepts all the props of the `TogglePrimitive.Root` component and the `VariantProps` of the `toggleVariants`.

The `Toggle` component returns the `TogglePrimitive.Root` component with the passed ref and className. The className is generated by the `toggleVariants` function with the passed `variant`, `size`, and `className`.

The `Toggle` component also spreads the remaining props (`...props`) to the `TogglePrimitive.Root` component.

## Display Name

The display name of the `Toggle` component is set to the display name of the `TogglePrimitive.Root` component.

## Exports

The `Toggle` component and the `toggleVariants` function are exported from this file.
