# Advanced Settings Component Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `AdvancedSettings` component found in the file `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/ui/advanced-settings.tsx`.

## Code Overview

The `AdvancedSettings` component is a functional component written in TypeScript that uses the `Collapsible` component to display or hide advanced settings. The component's open or closed state is managed using the `useState` hook from React.

## Import Statements

```ts
import {
  Collapsible,
  CollapsibleContent,
  CollapsibleTrigger
} from "@/components/ui/collapsible"
import { IconChevronDown, IconChevronRight } from "@tabler/icons-react"
import { FC, useState } from "react"
```

The import statements at the top of the file bring in necessary components and functions from external libraries. The `Collapsible`, `CollapsibleContent`, and `CollapsibleTrigger` components are imported from a local file, `collapsible.tsx`. The `IconChevronDown` and `IconChevronRight` are imported from the `@tabler/icons-react` library. The `FC` (Functional Component) type and `useState` hook are imported from React.

## Interface Definition

```ts
interface AdvancedSettingsProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
}
```

The `AdvancedSettingsProps` interface defines the props that the `AdvancedSettings` component expects to receive. In this case, it expects a `children` prop, which is of type `React.ReactNode`. This allows any valid React node to be passed as children to the `AdvancedSettings` component.

## Component Definition

```ts
export const AdvancedSettings: FC<AdvancedSettingsProps> = ({ children }) => {
  //...
}
```

The `AdvancedSettings` component is a functional component that accepts props of type `AdvancedSettingsProps`. It destructures `children` from the props.

## State Management

```ts
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(
  false
  // localStorage.getItem("advanced-settings-open") === "true"
)
```

The `useState` hook is used to manage the open or closed state of the `AdvancedSettings` component. The initial state is set to `false`, meaning the component is closed by default.

## Event Handlers

```ts
const handleOpenChange = (isOpen: boolean) => {
  setIsOpen(isOpen)
  // localStorage.setItem("advanced-settings-open", String(isOpen))
}
```

The `handleOpenChange` function is an event handler that updates the `isOpen` state when the open or closed state of the `Collapsible` component changes.

## Render Method

```ts
return (
  //...
)
```

The render method returns the JSX to be rendered by the `AdvancedSettings` component. It uses the `Collapsible`, `CollapsibleTrigger`, and `CollapsibleContent` components to create a collapsible advanced settings section. The `children` prop is rendered inside the `CollapsibleContent` component. The `IconChevronDown` or `IconChevronRight` icon is displayed based on the `isOpen` state.
