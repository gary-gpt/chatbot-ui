# MessageReplies Component Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `MessageReplies` component in the source code.

## Import Statements

The component imports several dependencies:

- `IconMessage` from `@tabler/icons-react` for displaying an icon.
- `FC` and `useState` from `react` for defining the component and managing state.
- Several components from `../ui/sheet` for creating a sheet-like UI.
- `WithTooltip` from `../ui/with-tooltip` for displaying tooltips.
- `MESSAGE_ICON_SIZE` from `./message-actions` for setting the size of the message icon.

## Props

The `MessageReplies` component does not take any props.

## State

The component maintains a single piece of state, `isOpen`, which is a boolean indicating whether the sheet is open or not.

## Rendered JSX

The component returns a `Sheet` component. The `open` prop of the `Sheet` is set to `isOpen`, and `onOpenChange` is set to `setIsOpen`, allowing the sheet to open and close based on the state.

Inside the `Sheet`, there are two main parts:

- `SheetTrigger`: This is the element that, when clicked, opens the sheet. It contains a `WithTooltip` component that shows a tooltip with the text "View Replies" when hovered over. The trigger itself is a `div` with a message icon and a notification indicator. When this `div` is clicked, `setIsOpen` is called with `true`, opening the sheet.

- `SheetContent`: This contains the content of the sheet. It includes a `SheetHeader` with a `SheetTitle` and a `SheetDescription`. The title asks the user for confirmation, and the description warns the user that the action is irreversible.

## Usage

This component can be used in any part of the application where a message reply functionality is needed. When the message icon is clicked, a sheet opens asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with an action.
