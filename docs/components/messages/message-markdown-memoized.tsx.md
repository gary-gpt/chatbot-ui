# Message Markdown Memoized Component

This file is located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/messages/message-markdown-memoized.tsx`. It exports a single component, `MessageMarkdownMemoized`, which is a memoized version of the `ReactMarkdown` component from the `react-markdown` library.

## Code Overview

```ts
import { FC, memo } from "react"
import ReactMarkdown, { Options } from "react-markdown"

export const MessageMarkdownMemoized: FC<Options> = memo(
  ReactMarkdown,
  (prevProps, nextProps) =>
    prevProps.children === nextProps.children &&
    prevProps.className === nextProps.className
)
```

## Import Statements

The code starts by importing the necessary modules and components:

- `FC` (Function Component) and `memo` from `react`: `FC` is a type used for function components in TypeScript. `memo` is a higher order component that memorizes the output of a component and only re-renders it if its props have changed.
- `ReactMarkdown` and `Options` from `react-markdown`: `ReactMarkdown` is a component that renders Markdown as React components. `Options` is a type that represents the props accepted by `ReactMarkdown`.

## MessageMarkdownMemoized Component

The `MessageMarkdownMemoized` component is a memoized version of the `ReactMarkdown` component. It is defined as a function component (`FC`) that accepts props of type `Options`.

The `memo` function takes two arguments:

1. The component to memoize, in this case `ReactMarkdown`.
2. A comparison function that determines whether the props have changed and the component needs to be re-rendered. This function takes the previous and next props as arguments and returns `true` if the props have not changed and `false` otherwise.

In this case, the comparison function checks if the `children` and `className` props have not changed. If both props are the same in the previous and next props, the function returns `true` and the component is not re-rendered. If either prop has changed, the function returns `false` and the component is re-rendered.

This memoization can improve performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders of the `ReactMarkdown` component.
