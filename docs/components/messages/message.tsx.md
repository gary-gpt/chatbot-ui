# Message Component Documentation

This document provides an overview of the `Message` component in the `chatbot-ui` application. The component is located in the file: `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/messages/message.tsx`.

## Overview

The `Message` component is a functional component that displays a chat message in the chat interface. It handles both user and assistant messages, as well as system prompts. The component provides features like editing messages, copying message content, regenerating assistant messages, and viewing file sources related to a message.

## Imports

The component imports several hooks, contexts, types, and components from various modules within the application. It also imports several icons from the `@tabler/icons-react` package.

## Props

The `Message` component accepts the following props:

- `message`: The message object to be displayed.
- `fileItems`: An array of file items related to the message.
- `isEditing`: A boolean indicating whether the message is currently being edited.
- `isLast`: A boolean indicating whether the message is the last one in the chat.
- `onStartEdit`: A function to be called when the user starts editing a message.
- `onCancelEdit`: A function to be called when the user cancels editing a message.
- `onSubmitEdit`: A function to be called when the user submits an edited message.

## State Variables

The component uses several state variables to manage its internal state, including:

- `isHovering`: Indicates whether the mouse is hovering over the message.
- `editedMessage`: The current content of the message being edited.
- `showImagePreview`: Controls the visibility of the image preview modal.
- `selectedImage`: The currently selected image for preview.
- `showFileItemPreview`: Controls the visibility of the file item preview modal.
- `selectedFileItem`: The currently selected file item for preview.
- `viewSources`: Controls whether the file sources for a message are visible.

## Event Handlers

The component defines several event handlers, including:

- `handleCopy`: Copies the message content to the clipboard.
- `handleSendEdit`: Submits an edited message and cancels editing mode.
- `handleKeyDown`: Handles keyboard events during message editing.
- `handleRegenerate`: Regenerates an assistant message.
- `handleStartEdit`: Starts editing a message.

## Rendered JSX

The component renders a div that contains the message content, message actions, and related file sources. If the message is being edited, a textarea is displayed for the user to edit the message content. If the message has related file items, a list of file sources is displayed.

## Preview Modals

The component can display two types of preview modals: an image preview modal and a file item preview modal. The visibility of these modals is controlled by the `showImagePreview` and `showFileItemPreview` state variables, respectively. The content of the modals is determined by the `selectedImage` and `selectedFileItem` state variables.

## Code Summary

```ts
// Import necessary dependencies

// Define the Message component
export const Message: FC<MessageProps> = ({
  message,
  fileItems,
  isEditing,
  isLast,
  onStartEdit,
  onCancelEdit,
  onSubmitEdit
}) => {
  // Use context and hooks

  // Define state variables

  // Define event handlers

  // Render the component
  return (
    // JSX code...
  )
}
```

## Conclusion

The `Message` component is a key part of the chat interface in the `chatbot-ui` application. It handles the display of chat messages and provides several features to interact with these messages.
