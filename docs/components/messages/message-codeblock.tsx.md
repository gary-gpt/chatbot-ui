# MessageCodeBlock Component Documentation

This document provides an overview of the `MessageCodeBlock` component located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/messages/message-codeblock.tsx`. This component is used to display code blocks in a chat interface, with syntax highlighting and options to copy or download the code.

## Import Statements

```ts
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { useCopyToClipboard } from "@/lib/hooks/use-copy-to-clipboard"
import { IconCheck, IconCopy, IconDownload } from "@tabler/icons-react"
import { FC, memo } from "react"
import { Prism as SyntaxHighlighter } from "react-syntax-highlighter"
import { oneDark } from "react-syntax-highlighter/dist/cjs/styles/prism"
```

The component imports several dependencies, including:

- A `Button` component for user interactions.
- A `useCopyToClipboard` hook to enable copying code to the clipboard.
- Several icons from `@tabler/icons-react` for the user interface.
- The `Prism` component from `react-syntax-highlighter` for syntax highlighting.
- The `oneDark` style from `react-syntax-highlighter` for the code block's appearance.

## Interfaces

```ts
interface MessageCodeBlockProps {
  language: string
  value: string
}

interface languageMap {
  [key: string]: string | undefined
}
```

The `MessageCodeBlockProps` interface defines the props for the `MessageCodeBlock` component. It expects two properties: `language` (the programming language of the code block) and `value` (the code to be displayed).

The `languageMap` interface is used to map programming language names to their respective file extensions.

## Constants and Helper Functions

```ts
export const programmingLanguages: languageMap = { ... }

export const generateRandomString = (length: number, lowercase = false) => { ... }
```

The `programmingLanguages` constant is a map of programming language names to their file extensions, using the `languageMap` interface.

The `generateRandomString` function generates a random string of a specified length. It can generate either uppercase or lowercase strings.

## MessageCodeBlock Component

```ts
export const MessageCodeBlock: FC<MessageCodeBlockProps> = memo(
  ({ language, value }) => { ... }
)
```

The `MessageCodeBlock` component is a functional component that uses the `MessageCodeBlockProps` interface for its props. It is wrapped in `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

The component provides a code block with syntax highlighting for the specified language. It also includes buttons for copying the code to the clipboard and downloading the code as a file.

The `downloadAsFile` function creates a file with the code and prompts the user to save it. The `onCopy` function copies the code to the clipboard.

The component returns a `div` element with the code block and the buttons. The `SyntaxHighlighter` component is used to display the code with syntax highlighting.

## Export Statement

```ts
MessageCodeBlock.displayName = "MessageCodeBlock"
```

The `displayName` property is set to "MessageCodeBlock" for debugging purposes.
