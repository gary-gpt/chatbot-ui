# Message Markdown Component Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `message-markdown.tsx` file located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/components/messages/`. This file exports a `MessageMarkdown` component which is a functional component in React that is used to render markdown content in a chatbot message.

## Imports

```ts
import React, { FC } from "react"
import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm"
import remarkMath from "remark-math"
import { MessageCodeBlock } from "./message-codeblock"
import { MessageMarkdownMemoized } from "./message-markdown-memoized"
```

The file imports several modules:

- `React` and `FC` (Functional Component) from the `react` library.
- `remarkGfm` and `remarkMath` are plugins for the `remark` markdown processor, which add support for GitHub Flavored Markdown and math syntax respectively.
- `MessageCodeBlock` is a component used to render code blocks.
- `MessageMarkdownMemoized` is a memoized version of the `MessageMarkdown` component, which improves performance by re-rendering only when the props change.

## Component Props

```ts
interface MessageMarkdownProps {
  content: string
}
```

The `MessageMarkdown` component accepts a single prop `content` which is a string that represents the markdown content to be rendered.

## Component Definition

```ts
export const MessageMarkdown: FC<MessageMarkdownProps> = ({ content }) => {
  // Component logic...
}
```

The `MessageMarkdown` component is a functional component that takes `MessageMarkdownProps` as its props.

## Component Logic

The component returns a `MessageMarkdownMemoized` component with several props:

- `className`: A string of CSS classes to style the component.
- `remarkPlugins`: An array of plugins to be used by the `remark` markdown processor.
- `components`: An object that maps markdown elements to React components.

The `components` prop is where most of the logic resides. It defines how different markdown elements (`p`, `img`, `code`) are rendered:

- `p` elements are rendered as `p` elements with a specific CSS class.
- `img` elements are rendered as `img` elements with a specific CSS class.
- `code` elements are rendered either as `code` elements or `MessageCodeBlock` components, depending on their content.

The `code` rendering logic is quite complex and involves several steps:

1. It first checks if the first child of the `code` element is a special character (`▍`). If it is, it renders a `span` element with a specific CSS class.
2. It then checks if the first child is a string. If it is, it replaces a special string (`"`▍`"`) with the special character (`▍`).
3. It then checks if the `className` of the `code` element matches a specific pattern (`language-(\w+)`). If it does, it extracts the language from the `className`.
4. It then checks if the first child is a string and does not include a newline character. If it does, it renders a `code` element with the modified children.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, it renders a `MessageCodeBlock` component with the extracted language and the modified children.

Finally, the `content` prop is passed as children to the `MessageCodeBlock` component.
