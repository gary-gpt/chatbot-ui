# TranslationsProvider

This is a React component that provides translations for its child components using the `react-i18next` library.

## Import Statements

```javascript
import initTranslations from "@/lib/i18n"
import { createInstance } from "i18next"
import { I18nextProvider } from "react-i18next"
```

The `initTranslations` function is imported from a local file located at `@/lib/i18n`. This function is used to initialize the translations.

The `createInstance` function is imported from the `i18next` library. This function is used to create an instance of `i18next`.

The `I18nextProvider` component is imported from the `react-i18next` library. This component is used to provide the `i18next` instance to the child components.

## Function Definition

```javascript
export default function TranslationsProvider({
  children,
  locale,
  namespaces,
  resources
}: any) {
  const i18n = createInstance()

  initTranslations(locale, namespaces, i18n, resources)

  return <I18nextProvider i18n={i18n}>{children}</I18nextProvider>
}
```

The `TranslationsProvider` function is a default export from this file. This function accepts an object as an argument with the following properties:

- `children`: The child components that will be rendered inside the `I18nextProvider` component.
- `locale`: The locale to be used for the translations.
- `namespaces`: The namespaces to be used for the translations.
- `resources`: The resources to be used for the translations.

Inside the function, an instance of `i18next` is created and stored in the `i18n` constant. The `initTranslations` function is then called with the `locale`, `namespaces`, `i18n`, and `resources` as arguments to initialize the translations.

Finally, the `I18nextProvider` component is returned. This component is given the `i18n` instance as a prop and the `children` are rendered inside it. This allows the child components to have access to the `i18n` instance and therefore the translations.
