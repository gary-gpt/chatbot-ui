# Change Password Component Documentation

The `change-password.tsx` file is a React component that provides a user interface for changing the password of a user in a chatbot application. It uses the Supabase client to interact with the backend for updating the user's password.

## Code Overview

```ts
"use client"
```
This line indicates that the code runs on the client-side.

## Imports

```ts
import { supabase } from "@/lib/supabase/browser-client"
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"
import { FC, useState } from "react"
import { Button } from "../ui/button"
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogContent,
  DialogFooter,
  DialogHeader,
  DialogTitle
} from "../ui/dialog"
import { Input } from "../ui/input"
import { toast } from "sonner"
```
The component imports several dependencies:

- `supabase`: The Supabase client for interacting with the backend.
- `useRouter`: A hook from Next.js for routing.
- `FC` and `useState`: React's Function Component and state hook.
- `Button`, `Dialog`, `DialogContent`, `DialogFooter`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogTitle`, and `Input`: UI components for the dialog.
- `toast`: A library for showing toast notifications.

## Component Definition

```ts
interface ChangePasswordProps {}

export const ChangePassword: FC<ChangePasswordProps> = () => {
  // ...
}
```
The `ChangePassword` component is a function component that doesn't take any props.

## State Variables

```ts
const [newPassword, setNewPassword] = useState("")
const [confirmPassword, setConfirmPassword] = useState("")
```
The component maintains two state variables: `newPassword` and `confirmPassword`. These variables hold the values of the new password and its confirmation.

## Password Reset Handler

```ts
const handleResetPassword = async () => {
  if (!newPassword) return toast.info("Please enter your new password.")

  await supabase.auth.updateUser({ password: newPassword })

  toast.success("Password changed successfully.")

  return router.push("/login")
}
```
The `handleResetPassword` function is an async function that handles the password reset process. It first checks if the `newPassword` is not empty. If it's empty, it shows a toast notification asking the user to enter the new password. Then, it calls `supabase.auth.updateUser` to update the user's password. After the password is updated, it shows a success toast notification and redirects the user to the login page.

## Component Return

```ts
return (
  <Dialog open={true}>
    // ...
  </Dialog>
)
```
The component returns a `Dialog` component that contains the form for changing the password. The form includes two `Input` components for entering the new password and its confirmation, and a `Button` component for submitting the form. The `handleResetPassword` function is attached to the `onClick` event of the `Button` component.
