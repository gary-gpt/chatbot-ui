# Import Component

This component is responsible for importing data from JSON files into the chatbot application. The imported data can be of various types such as chats, presets, prompts, files, collections, assistants, and tools.

## Props

The `Import` component does not accept any props.

## State

The `Import` component maintains several state variables:

- `isOpen`: A boolean indicating whether the import dialog is open or not.
- `importList`: An array of objects representing the data to be imported.
- `importCounts`: An object keeping track of the number of items to be imported for each data type.

## Functions

The `Import` component defines several functions:

- `handleSelectFiles`: This function is triggered when the user selects files to import. It reads the files, parses the JSON data, and updates the `importList` and `importCounts` state variables.
- `handleRemoveItem`: This function removes a specific item from the `importList` and updates the `importCounts`.
- `handleCancel`: This function resets the `importList` and `importCounts` and closes the import dialog.
- `handleSaveData`: This function saves the imported data to the respective databases and updates the application state accordingly.
- `handleKeyDown`: This function listens for the `Enter` key press and triggers the `handleSaveData` function.

## Rendered UI

The `Import` component renders an upload icon. When clicked, a dialog opens where the user can select JSON files to import. The dialog displays the list of selected files and the counts of items to be imported for each data type. The user can remove individual items from the list or cancel the import operation. When the user clicks the "Save Data" button, the `handleSaveData` function is triggered to save the imported data.
