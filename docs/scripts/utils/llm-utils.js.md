## Function: generateMarkdownFromCode

This function is designed to call the OpenAI API to generate markdown documentation from source code.

```javascript
async function generateMarkdownFromCode(code, filePath)
```

### Parameters

- `code` (string): The raw code that needs to be documented.
- `filePath` (string): The file path of the source code. This is used for logging purposes.

### Returns

- `Promise<string|null>`: Returns a Promise that resolves to a Markdown string if successful, or null if an error occurs.

### Description

The function first sets up the API key and base URL for the OpenAI API. It then constructs the headers and payload for the API request. The payload includes a model specification ('gpt-4'), a set of messages that instruct the model on what to do, and a temperature setting that controls the randomness of the model's output.

The function then makes a POST request to the OpenAI API with the headers and payload. If the request is successful, the function parses the response as JSON and checks if the HTTP response was OK. If not, it logs an error message and returns null.

If the HTTP response was OK, the function extracts the generated documentation text from the response data. If the extracted text is empty, it logs a warning message.

Finally, the function logs a debug message showing a snippet of the generated documentation text and returns this text. If any error occurs during this process, the function logs an error message and returns null.

### Example

```javascript
generateMarkdownFromCode('function helloWorld() { console.log("Hello, world!"); }', './path/to/file.js')
  .then(doc => console.log(doc))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

This will generate markdown documentation for the provided code and log it to the console. If an error occurs, it will log the error message instead.
