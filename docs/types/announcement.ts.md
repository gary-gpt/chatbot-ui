# Announcement Interface Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `Announcement` interface located in the file `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/types/announcement.ts`. This interface is written in TypeScript.

## Overview

The `Announcement` interface is a TypeScript interface that defines the structure of an announcement object. This object is likely used to display announcements in a chatbot UI.

## Code Explanation

```ts
export interface Announcement {
  id: string
  title: string
  content: string
  read: boolean
  link: string
  date: string
}
```

The `Announcement` interface consists of the following properties:

- `id`: A string that uniquely identifies each announcement.
- `title`: A string that holds the title of the announcement.
- `content`: A string that contains the main content of the announcement.
- `read`: A boolean that indicates whether the announcement has been read or not. If the value is `true`, the announcement has been read; if `false`, it has not been read.
- `link`: A string that contains a URL link related to the announcement. This could be a link to further information or a related resource.
- `date`: A string that holds the date of the announcement. This is likely in a standard date format such as 'YYYY-MM-DD'.

## Usage

This interface is used to ensure any object labeled as an `Announcement` contains the necessary properties. It is exported, meaning it can be used in other parts of the application where it is imported.

For example, an object that uses this interface may look like this:

```ts
let newAnnouncement: Announcement = {
  id: '123',
  title: 'New Feature',
  content: 'We have released a new feature...',
  read: false,
  link: 'https://www.example.com/new-feature',
  date: '2022-01-01'
}
```

This object can then be used in the application, with the assurance that it contains all the necessary properties of an `Announcement`.
