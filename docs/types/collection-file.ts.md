# CollectionFile Interface Documentation

This document provides an overview of the `CollectionFile` interface found in the file `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/types/collection-file.ts`.

## Overview

The `CollectionFile` interface is a TypeScript interface that defines the shape of an object representing a collection file in the chatbot UI.

## Code Summary

```ts
export interface CollectionFile {
  id: string
  name: string
  type: string
}
```

## Interface Details

The `CollectionFile` interface consists of three properties:

- `id`: A string that represents the unique identifier for the collection file.
- `name`: A string that represents the name of the collection file.
- `type`: A string that represents the type of the collection file.

### `id`

The `id` is a string that uniquely identifies each collection file. This could be a UUID or any other unique string identifier.

### `name`

The `name` is a string that represents the name of the collection file. This is typically a human-readable name that provides a brief description of the file's content.

### `type`

The `type` is a string that represents the type of the collection file. This could be used to categorize the files, for example, by their content or format.

## Usage

The `CollectionFile` interface is typically used when working with collection files in the chatbot UI. For example, it can be used to type-check objects that are meant to represent collection files, ensuring they have the correct structure and properties.

Here is an example of how to use the `CollectionFile` interface:

```ts
const collectionFile: CollectionFile = {
  id: '123',
  name: 'My Collection File',
  type: 'text'
};
```

In this example, `collectionFile` is an object that adheres to the `CollectionFile` interface. It has an `id`, `name`, and `type` property, all of which are strings.
