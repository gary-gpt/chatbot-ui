# CollectionFile Interface Documentation

The `CollectionFile` interface is a TypeScript interface that represents a file within a collection. This interface is defined in the source code as follows:

```typescript
export interface CollectionFile {
  id: string
  string: name
  type: string
}
```

## Properties

### `id: string`

The `id` property is a string that represents the unique identifier of the file within the collection. This is typically a UUID but can be any string that uniquely identifies the file.

### `name: string`

The `name` property is a string that represents the name of the file. This is the name that will be displayed in any user interfaces that present this file to the user.

### `type: string`

The `type` property is a string that represents the type of the file. This could be any string that describes the file type, such as "text", "image", "video", etc. The specific values that are valid for this property will depend on the specific application's requirements and implementation.

## Example

Here's an example of how a `CollectionFile` object might look:

```typescript
const file: CollectionFile = {
  id: '1234',
  name: 'example.txt',
  type: 'text'
}
```

In this example, `file` is an object that implements the `CollectionFile` interface. It represents a text file named "example.txt" with an id of "1234".
