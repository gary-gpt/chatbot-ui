# Chat File Interface Documentation

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `ChatFile` interface in the `chat-file.tsx` TypeScript file located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/types/chat-file.tsx`.

## Code Overview

The `ChatFile` interface is a TypeScript interface that describes the structure of a chat file object. This object is used to manage file data in the chatbot UI.

```ts
export interface ChatFile {
  id: string
  name: string
  type: string
  file: File | null
}
```

## Interface Properties

The `ChatFile` interface consists of four properties: `id`, `name`, `type`, and `file`.

### id

The `id` property is a string that uniquely identifies a chat file. This could be a UUID or any other unique identifier.

```ts
id: string
```

### name

The `name` property is a string that represents the name of the chat file. This is typically the original filename of the file.

```ts
name: string
```

### type

The `type` property is a string that represents the type of the chat file. This could be any file type, such as 'image', 'audio', 'video', 'text', etc.

```ts
type: string
```

### file

The `file` property is a `File` object that represents the actual file data. This could be any file that the user wants to send or receive in the chat. If there is no file data, this property can be `null`.

```ts
file: File | null
```

## Conclusion

The `ChatFile` interface is a simple and effective way to manage file data in the chatbot UI. By defining the structure of the chat file object, it ensures that all chat files have a consistent structure and makes it easier to handle file data in the chatbot UI.
