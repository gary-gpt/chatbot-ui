# ChatFile Interface Documentation

The `ChatFile` interface is a TypeScript interface that represents a chat file within the application. This interface is used to define the structure of an object that represents a file in a chat.

## Properties

### `id: string`

The `id` property is a unique identifier for the chat file. This is a string value and it should be unique for each file.

### `name: string`

The `name` property represents the name of the chat file. This is a string value.

### `type: string`

The `type` property represents the type of the chat file. This is a string value. The type of the file can be any string, but typically it should represent the file extension (e.g., 'jpg', 'png', 'docx', etc.).

### `file: File | null`

The `file` property represents the actual file object. This can be an instance of the `File` object, or `null` if no file is associated. The `File` object represents a file in the web applications, which can be used to read data from the file or upload a file to a server. If no file is associated with the chat file, this property should be `null`.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the `ChatFile` interface:

```typescript
let chatFile: ChatFile = {
  id: '1',
  name: 'example.jpg',
  type: 'jpg',
  file: new File([""], "filename"),
};
```

In the example above, we create a `ChatFile` object named `chatFile`. This object represents a 'jpg' file named 'example.jpg' with the id '1'. The actual file object is created using the `File` constructor.
