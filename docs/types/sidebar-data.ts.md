# Documentation

## Overview
This file contains type definitions for data list and data item types. These types are used to define the structure of data related to different tables in the Supabase database.

## Imports
The file imports the `Tables` type from the `@/supabase/types` module.

## Types

### `DataListType`

This is a union type that represents a list of items from various tables in the Supabase database. The tables include:

- `collections`
- `chats`
- `presets`
- `prompts`
- `files`
- `assistants`
- `tools`
- `models`

Each item in the list is an array of the `Tables` type, parameterized by the name of the table.

### `DataItemType`

This is a union type that represents a single item from various tables in the Supabase database. The tables include:

- `collections`
- `chats`
- `presets`
- `prompts`
- `files`
- `assistants`
- `tools`
- `models`

Each item is of the `Tables` type, parameterized by the name of the table.

## Usage

These types are typically used when interacting with the Supabase database. They provide a way to ensure that the data being fetched from or inserted into the database matches the expected structure.
