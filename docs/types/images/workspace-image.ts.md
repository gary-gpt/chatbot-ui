# Workspace Image Interface Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the `WorkspaceImage` interface located in the file: `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/types/images/workspace-image.ts`.

## Overview

The `WorkspaceImage` interface is a TypeScript interface that represents the structure of an image related to a specific workspace in a chatbot user interface. It defines the properties that an object of type `WorkspaceImage` should have.

## Interface Definition

```ts
export interface WorkspaceImage {
  workspaceId: string
  path: string
  base64: any // base64 image
  url: string
}
```

### Properties

The `WorkspaceImage` interface has the following properties:

- `workspaceId`: A string that represents the unique identifier of the workspace. This is used to associate the image with a specific workspace.

- `path`: A string that represents the path of the image file in the system.

- `base64`: This property holds the base64 representation of the image. The base64 format is used to encode binary data, like images, to ASCII characters. This allows the image to be easily stored and transferred over networks. The type of this property is `any` to allow flexibility in the type of data that can be stored (though it is typically a string).

- `url`: A string that represents the URL of the image. This could be a local path or a remote URL, depending on where the image is stored.

## Usage

This interface can be used to type-check objects that represent workspace images, ensuring they have the correct structure. For example, when fetching or updating workspace images from a database or an API, you can use the `WorkspaceImage` interface to ensure the data has the correct structure.

## Conclusion

This `WorkspaceImage` interface is a key part of managing images in the chatbot UI, ensuring that all workspace images have a consistent structure and that all necessary data is present.
