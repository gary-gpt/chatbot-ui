# FileItemChunk Type Documentation

The `FileItemChunk` type is an exported type from this source code file. This type is an object that is used to represent a chunk of a file item. It is composed of two properties: `content` and `tokens`.

## Properties

### `content`

The `content` property is of type `string`. This property is used to store the actual content of the file item chunk. 

Example:

```typescript
{
  content: "This is a sample content of a file item chunk."
}
```

### `tokens`

The `tokens` property is of type `number`. This property is used to store the number of tokens in the file item chunk. Tokens are typically individual words or symbols in the content that are used for processing or parsing the content.

Example:

```typescript
{
  tokens: 10
}
```

## Usage

The `FileItemChunk` type can be used to create objects that represent chunks of a file item. These objects can then be used in various parts of the application where file item chunks need to be processed or manipulated.

Example:

```typescript
let fileItemChunk: FileItemChunk = {
  content: "This is a sample content of a file item chunk.",
  tokens: 10
};
```

This creates a `FileItemChunk` object with a `content` of "This is a sample content of a file item chunk." and `tokens` of 10.
