# Assistant Retrieval Item Interface Documentation

This documentation covers the `AssistantRetrievalItem` interface located in the file `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/types/assistant-retrieval-item.ts`. This interface is used to define the structure of an assistant retrieval item in the chatbot UI.

## Interface Overview

```ts
export interface AssistantRetrievalItem {
  id: string
  name: string
  type: string
}
```

The `AssistantRetrievalItem` interface has three properties: `id`, `name`, and `type`. All of these properties are of the `string` type.

### Properties

- `id`: This is a unique identifier for the assistant retrieval item. It is a string and should be unique for each item.
- `name`: This is the name of the assistant retrieval item. It is also a string. This could be used to display the name of the item in the UI.
- `type`: This is a string that indicates the type of the assistant retrieval item. This could be used to categorize the items or to perform specific actions based on the type of the item.

## Usage

This interface is typically used wherever an assistant retrieval item needs to be handled in the code. For example, it could be used as the type for a function parameter that expects an assistant retrieval item, or for a state variable that stores a list of assistant retrieval items.

```ts
function handleItem(item: AssistantRetrievalItem) {
  // function body
}

const items: AssistantRetrievalItem[] = [];
```

In the above examples, `handleItem` is a function that expects an `AssistantRetrievalItem` as a parameter, and `items` is a state variable that stores a list of `AssistantRetrievalItem` objects.
