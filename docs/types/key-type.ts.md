# Key Type Documentation

This document provides an overview of the `key-type.ts` TypeScript file located at `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/types/key-type.ts`.

## File Summary

The `key-type.ts` file exports a TypeScript type named `EnvKey`. This type is a union of string literal types, each representing a specific environment key used in the application. These keys are used to access various APIs, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, Groq, Perplexity, and Azure OpenAI.

## Code Breakdown

```ts
export type EnvKey =
  | "OPENAI_API_KEY"
  | "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
  | "GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"
  | "MISTRAL_API_KEY"
  | "GROQ_API_KEY"
  | "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY"
  | "AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

This code exports a type `EnvKey` which is a union type of several string literals. Each string literal represents a unique environment key. These keys are used to access various APIs within the application.

- `"OPENAI_API_KEY"`: This key is used to access the OpenAI API.
- `"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"`: This key is used to access the Anthropic API.
- `"GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY"`: This key is used to access the Google Gemini API.
- `"MISTRAL_API_KEY"`: This key is used to access the Mistral API.
- `"GROQ_API_KEY"`: This key is used to access the Groq API.
- `"PERPLEXITY_API_KEY"`: This key is used to access the Perplexity API.
- `"AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY"`: This key is used to access the Azure OpenAI API.

## Conclusion

The `key-type.ts` file is a simple, yet crucial part of the application. It provides a standardized way of referring to the various API keys used throughout the application, ensuring consistency and reducing the likelihood of errors.
