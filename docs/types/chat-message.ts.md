# Chat Message Interface Documentation

This document provides an overview of the `/Users/garymason/chatbot-ui/types/chat-message.ts` file. This TypeScript file defines an interface `ChatMessage` used in a chatbot application. 

## Code Overview

The `chat-message.ts` file is a TypeScript file that exports a `ChatMessage` interface. This interface is used to type the structure of chat messages in the chatbot application. 

```ts
import { Tables } from "@/supabase/types"

export interface ChatMessage {
  message: Tables<"messages">
  fileItems: string[]
}
```
## Code Breakdown

### Import Statement

```ts
import { Tables } from "@/supabase/types"
```

This line imports the `Tables` type from the `types` file located in the `supabase` directory. The `Tables` type is a generic type used to define the structure of tables in the Supabase database.

### ChatMessage Interface

```ts
export interface ChatMessage {
  message: Tables<"messages">
  fileItems: string[]
}
```

This is the `ChatMessage` interface. It has two properties: `message` and `fileItems`.

- `message`: This property is of type `Tables<"messages">`. It represents a message in the chat. The type `Tables<"messages">` refers to the structure of the "messages" table in the Supabase database.

- `fileItems`: This property is an array of strings. It represents the file items associated with a chat message. Each string in the array is a file item.

## Summary

This TypeScript file is crucial for maintaining type safety in the chatbot application. By defining the structure of chat messages using the `ChatMessage` interface, we can ensure that all chat messages in the application adhere to the correct format.
