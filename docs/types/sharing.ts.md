# Sharing Type Definition

This document provides a brief overview of the `Sharing` type definition in the source code.

## Type Definition

The `Sharing` type is defined as follows:

```typescript
export type Sharing = "private" | "public" | "unlisted"
```

## Description

The `Sharing` type is an exported type that represents the different sharing settings that can be applied. It is a TypeScript union type, meaning a value of type `Sharing` can be one of several possible values.

In this case, a `Sharing` type can have one of the following three string values:

- `"private"`: This value is used to represent a private sharing setting.
- `"public"`: This value is used to represent a public sharing setting.
- `"unlisted"`: This value is used to represent an unlisted sharing setting.

## Usage

The `Sharing` type can be used in the code wherever a sharing setting needs to be specified. Here is an example:

```typescript
let sharingSetting: Sharing;
sharingSetting = "public"; // This is valid
sharingSetting = "private"; // This is also valid
sharingSetting = "unlisted"; // This is also valid
sharingSetting = "other"; // This would be invalid
```

In the above example, `sharingSetting` is declared as a variable of type `Sharing`. It can be assigned the values `"public"`, `"private"`, or `"unlisted"`, but any other value would result in a TypeScript error.
