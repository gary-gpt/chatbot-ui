# Jest Configuration

This file is responsible for configuring Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, for a Next.js application.

## Dependencies

This file imports the following dependencies:

- `Config` type from `jest`: This is a type that represents the configuration object for Jest.
- `nextJest` from `next/jest.js`: This is a function that creates a Jest configuration for a Next.js application.

## Configuration

A Jest configuration object is created by calling `nextJest` with an object that specifies the directory of the Next.js application. This directory is used to load the `next.config.js` and `.env` files in the test environment.

```javascript
const createJestConfig = nextJest({
  dir: "./"
})
```

A custom configuration object is then created, specifying the coverage provider and the test environment.

```javascript
const config: Config = {
  coverageProvider: "v8",
  testEnvironment: "jsdom"
}
```

The `coverageProvider` option is set to `"v8"`, which means that Jest will use V8's built-in code coverage tool to collect coverage information.

The `testEnvironment` option is set to `"jsdom"`, which means that Jest will use JSDOM to simulate a DOM environment for the tests.

## Export

The Jest configuration object is exported in a way that ensures `next/jest` can load the Next.js configuration, which is asynchronous.

```javascript
export default createJestConfig(config)
```

This export is the default export of the file, meaning it can be imported in other files using the `import` statement without curly braces.
