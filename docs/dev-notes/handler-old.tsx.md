# useChatHandler.ts

This TypeScript file is part of a chatbot application. It exports a hook named `useChatHandler`, which provides several functions to handle chat-related operations such as creating a new chat, sending a message, focusing on the chat input, stopping a message, and sending an edited message.

## Exports

### `useChatHandler`

This is a custom React hook that provides several functions and a reference to the chat input field. The functions are used to handle various chat-related operations. The hook uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to access various state variables and functions related to the chatbot UI.

The hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `chatInputRef`: A reference to the chat input field.
- `handleNewChat`: A function to handle the creation of a new chat.
- `handleSendMessage`: A function to handle sending a message.
- `handleFocusChatInput`: A function to focus on the chat input field.
- `handleStopMessage`: A function to stop a message.
- `handleSendEdit`: A function to handle sending an edited message.

## Usage

This hook is likely used in a component that needs to handle chat-related operations. The component can call `useChatHandler` to get access to the functions and the chat input reference. The functions can then be used to handle user interactions such as creating a new chat, sending a message, etc.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

This file makes heavy use of async/await for handling asynchronous operations, such as sending a message or creating a new chat. It also uses the `useContext` hook to access the `ChatbotUIContext`, which provides various state variables and functions related to the chatbot UI.

The `handleSendMessage` function is particularly complex, as it handles several different scenarios (e.g., if there are selected tools, if the provider is "ollama", etc.) and calls various helper functions. It also uses a `try/catch` block to handle any errors that may occur during the message sending process.

The `handleNewChat` function is also interesting, as it resets many state variables to their initial state when a new chat is created. It also retrieves various data (e.g., assistant files, assistant collections, etc.) related to the selected assistant or preset.
