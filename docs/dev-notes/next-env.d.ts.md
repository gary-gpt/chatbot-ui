# TypeScript Definitions for Next.js

This file is a TypeScript definition file for the Next.js framework. It provides type definitions for the Next.js and Next.js Image Types modules. This file is not meant to be edited directly, as it is automatically generated and maintained by the Next.js framework.

## What this file does

This file provides TypeScript type definitions for the Next.js framework. TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript, which adds static types to the language. Type definitions allow TypeScript to understand the types of variables, functions, and objects used in a JavaScript project. This helps to catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime, and also provides better autocompletion and understanding of the codebase for developers.

The file references two types: `next` and `next/image-types/global`. These are type definitions for the Next.js framework and the global image types used in Next.js, respectively.

## Exports, Types, and Functions

This file does not export any functions, types, or variables. It is a reference file, meaning it only provides type definitions for other files to use. It does not contain any executable code.

## Usage

This file is automatically used by TypeScript when compiling a Next.js project. It does not need to be imported or used directly. Any file in the project that uses Next.js or its global image types will automatically have access to these type definitions.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The interesting thing about this file is that it is not meant to be edited. This is because it is automatically generated and maintained by the Next.js framework. Any changes made to this file could be overwritten when the framework is updated.
