# assistant-collections.ts

This TypeScript file is part of a project that uses Supabase, a web-based platform that provides real-time databases and authentication for developers. The file provides functions for interacting with the `assistant_collections` table in a Supabase database. The functions allow for fetching, creating, and deleting assistant collections.

## Exports

The file exports four asynchronous functions:

### `getAssistantCollectionsByAssistantId(assistantId: string)`

This function fetches an assistant's collections from the `assistants` table by the assistant's ID. It returns the collections if they exist, otherwise, it throws an error.

### `createAssistantCollection(assistantCollection: TablesInsert<"assistant_collections">)`

This function creates a new assistant collection in the `assistant_collections` table. The function takes an object of type `TablesInsert<"assistant_collections">` as an argument, which represents the new assistant collection to be created. It returns the created assistant collection if successful, otherwise, it throws an error.

### `createAssistantCollections(assistantCollections: TablesInsert<"assistant_collections">[])`

This function is similar to `createAssistantCollection`, but it allows for creating multiple assistant collections at once. It takes an array of objects of type `TablesInsert<"assistant_collections">` as an argument. Each object in the array represents a new assistant collection to be created. The function returns the created assistant collections if successful, otherwise, it throws an error.

### `deleteAssistantCollection(assistantId: string, collectionId: string)`

This function deletes an assistant collection from the `assistant_collections` table. It takes the assistant's ID and the collection's ID as arguments. If the deletion is successful, it returns `true`, otherwise, it throws an error.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in the context of an application where assistants have collections that need to be managed. The functions would be used wherever these operations need to be performed, such as in API endpoints or event handlers.

## Structure and Nuance

The functions use the Supabase JavaScript client to interact with the database. Each function begins by making a request to the database using the `supabase` object. The response from the database is then checked for errors, and if an error is found, it is thrown. If the operation is successful, the relevant data is returned.

The use of TypeScript's generic `TablesInsert<"assistant_collections">` type for the `createAssistantCollection` and `createAssistantCollections` functions ensures type safety when creating new assistant collections. This means that TypeScript will enforce that the correct properties and types are provided when creating a new assistant collection.
