# Source File: Collection Files Management

This source file is a part of a JavaScript/TypeScript project that interacts with a Supabase database. It provides functions to manage collection files in the database. The functions include getting collection files by collection ID, creating a collection file, creating multiple collection files, and deleting a collection file.

## Exports and Functions

The file exports four asynchronous functions:

1. `getCollectionFilesByCollectionId(collectionId: string)`: This function retrieves collection files by their collection ID from the 'collections' table in the Supabase database. It returns an object containing the ID, name, and files (including the file's ID, name, and type) of the collection. If no collection files are found, it throws an error.

2. `createCollectionFile(collectionFile: TablesInsert<"collection_files">)`: This function creates a new collection file in the 'collection_files' table. It takes a `TablesInsert` object as an argument, which represents the new collection file to be inserted. The function returns the created collection file. If the creation fails, it throws an error.

3. `createCollectionFiles(collectionFiles: TablesInsert<"collection_files">[])`: Similar to `createCollectionFile`, this function creates multiple collection files. It takes an array of `TablesInsert` objects as an argument. The function returns the created collection files. If the creation fails, it throws an error.

4. `deleteCollectionFile(collectionId: string, fileId: string)`: This function deletes a collection file from the 'collection_files' table. It takes a collection ID and a file ID as arguments. If the deletion is successful, it returns `true`. If the deletion fails, it throws an error.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in a larger system where collection files need to be managed in a Supabase database. They can be imported and used in other parts of the project where such operations are required.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The file uses the Supabase JavaScript client to interact with the Supabase database. The client provides a fluent API to build and execute database queries. The file also uses TypeScript's generic types to ensure type safety when creating collection files. The `TablesInsert` type is a generic type that takes a string argument representing the table name. This ensures that the correct fields are provided when creating a new collection file.
