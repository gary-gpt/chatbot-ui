# browser-client.ts

This TypeScript file is part of a project that uses Supabase, a web-based platform that provides real-time databases and authentication for web applications. The file contains functions for interacting with the 'assistants' and 'assistant_tools' tables in a Supabase database.

## Exports

The file exports four functions:

### getAssistantToolsByAssistantId(assistantId: string)

This asynchronous function takes an assistant's ID as a parameter and returns the assistant's tools. It queries the 'assistants' table in the Supabase database, selecting the 'id', 'name', and 'tools' fields for the assistant with the given ID. If no tools are found for the assistant, it throws an error.

### createAssistantTool(assistantTool: TablesInsert<"assistant_tools">)

This asynchronous function takes an object representing an assistant tool as a parameter and inserts it into the 'assistant_tools' table in the Supabase database. It then returns the newly created assistant tool. If the tool cannot be created, it throws an error.

### createAssistantTools(assistantTools: TablesInsert<"assistant_tools">[])

This asynchronous function takes an array of objects representing assistant tools as a parameter and inserts them into the 'assistant_tools' table in the Supabase database. It then returns the newly created assistant tools. If the tools cannot be created, it throws an error.

### deleteAssistantTool(assistantId: string, toolId: string)

This asynchronous function takes an assistant's ID and a tool's ID as parameters and deletes the corresponding tool from the 'assistant_tools' table in the Supabase database. If the tool cannot be deleted, it throws an error. If the deletion is successful, it returns true.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in the context of a web application where assistants and their tools need to be managed. For example, `getAssistantToolsByAssistantId` could be used to display an assistant's tools on their profile page, while `createAssistantTool` and `deleteAssistantTool` could be used to add and remove tools from an assistant's profile.

## Structure and Nuance

The functions in this file make use of Supabase's JavaScript client to interact with the database. They all follow a similar structure: they perform a database operation (select, insert, or delete), check for errors, and return the result or throw an error. This consistent structure makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
