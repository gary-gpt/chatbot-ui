# assistantFiles.ts

This TypeScript file is part of a project that uses Supabase, a web-based platform that provides real-time databases and authentication for developers. The file provides functions to interact with the `assistants` and `assistant_files` tables in a Supabase database.

## Exports

The file exports four functions: `getAssistantFilesByAssistantId`, `createAssistantFile`, `createAssistantFiles`, and `deleteAssistantFile`.

### getAssistantFilesByAssistantId

This function retrieves an assistant's files from the `assistants` table in the database. It takes an `assistantId` as a parameter and returns a promise that resolves with the assistant's files. If the assistant does not have any files, the function throws an error.

### createAssistantFile

This function creates a new assistant file in the `assistant_files` table. It takes an `assistantFile` object as a parameter, which must conform to the `TablesInsert<"assistant_files">` type. The function returns a promise that resolves with the created assistant file. If the file cannot be created, the function throws an error.

### createAssistantFiles

This function is similar to `createAssistantFile`, but it allows for the creation of multiple assistant files at once. It takes an array of `assistantFile` objects as a parameter, each of which must conform to the `TablesInsert<"assistant_files">` type. The function returns a promise that resolves with the created assistant files. If the files cannot be created, the function throws an error.

### deleteAssistantFile

This function deletes an assistant file from the `assistant_files` table. It takes an `assistantId` and a `fileId` as parameters. The function returns a promise that resolves with `true` if the file is successfully deleted. If the file cannot be deleted, the function throws an error.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in the context of an application that manages assistants and their associated files. For example, `getAssistantFilesByAssistantId` could be used to display an assistant's files in a user interface, while `createAssistantFile` and `deleteAssistantFile` could be used to add and remove files from the interface, respectively.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The use of Supabase's fluent API is notable in these functions. This API allows for complex queries to be built up in a readable and intuitive way. For example, in `getAssistantFilesByAssistantId`, the `.from("assistants").select().eq("id", assistantId).single()` chain of method calls is used to construct a query that retrieves a single assistant's files from the `assistants` table.
