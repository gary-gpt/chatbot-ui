# Source File: messageFileItems.ts

This source file is part of a JavaScript/TypeScript project that interacts with a Supabase database. Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative. This file specifically deals with operations related to message file items in the database.

## Functions

This file exports two asynchronous functions: `getMessageFileItemsByMessageId` and `createMessageFileItems`.

### getMessageFileItemsByMessageId

This function retrieves message file items from the "messages" table in the Supabase database based on a given message ID. 

It takes a single argument:

- `messageId` (string): The ID of the message for which file items are to be retrieved.

The function queries the database for a message with the given ID and selects its `id` and `file_items`. If the query is successful, it returns the message file items. If not, it throws an error with the message from the Supabase client.

### createMessageFileItems

This function inserts new message file items into the "message_file_items" table in the Supabase database.

It takes a single argument:

- `messageFileItems` (Array of `TablesInsert<"message_file_items">`): An array of message file items to be inserted into the database.

The function attempts to insert the provided message file items into the database and selects all fields of the newly inserted items. If the insertion is successful, it returns the created message file items. If not, it throws an error with the message from the Supabase client.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in the context of a larger application where messages and their associated file items need to be managed. For example, `getMessageFileItemsByMessageId` could be used to display all file items associated with a particular message, while `createMessageFileItems` could be used when a user uploads new files to a message.

## Structure and Nuance

The structure of these functions is quite similar. Both functions interact with the Supabase client to perform database operations, handle potential errors, and return the resulting data. The use of the `.single()` method in `getMessageFileItemsByMessageId` indicates that message IDs are unique in the "messages" table. The use of the `TablesInsert` type in `createMessageFileItems` suggests a strong typing system in the project, likely indicating a TypeScript environment.
