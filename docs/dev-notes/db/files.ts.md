# File: Unnamed JavaScript/TypeScript File

This file is a part of a larger project that uses Supabase, a web-based platform for building digital products. The file primarily deals with file and workspace management, including functions for creating, updating, and deleting files and workspaces. It also handles the extraction of text from .docx files using the Mammoth.js library.

## Exports

This file exports several asynchronous functions:

- `getFileById(fileId: string)`: Fetches a file from the Supabase "files" table by its ID.
- `getFileWorkspacesByWorkspaceId(workspaceId: string)`: Fetches a workspace from the Supabase "workspaces" table by its ID, including all associated files.
- `getFileWorkspacesByFileId(fileId: string)`: Fetches a file from the Supabase "files" table by its ID, including all associated workspaces.
- `createFileBasedOnExtension(...)`: Creates a file record in the Supabase "files" table based on the file's extension. If the file is a .docx file, it extracts the raw text from the file using Mammoth.js before creating the record.
- `createFile(...)`: Creates a file record in the Supabase "files" table for non-.docx files.
- `createDocXFile(...)`: Creates a file record in the Supabase "files" table for .docx files, extracting the raw text from the file using Mammoth.js.
- `createFiles(...)`: Creates multiple file records in the Supabase "files" table.
- `createFileWorkspace(item: { user_id: string, file_id: string, workspace_id: string })`: Creates a record in the Supabase "file_workspaces" table, associating a file with a workspace.
- `createFileWorkspaces(...)`: Creates multiple records in the Supabase "file_workspaces" table, associating multiple files with a workspace.
- `updateFile(fileId: string, file: TablesUpdate<"files">)`: Updates a file record in the Supabase "files" table.
- `deleteFile(fileId: string)`: Deletes a file record from the Supabase "files" table.
- `deleteFileWorkspace(fileId: string, workspaceId: string)`: Deletes a record from the Supabase "file_workspaces" table, disassociating a file from a workspace.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The file uses the Supabase JavaScript library to interact with a Supabase database. It also uses the Mammoth.js library to extract raw text from .docx files, and the Sonner library to display toast notifications.

The `createFileBasedOnExtension`, `createFile`, and `createDocXFile` functions are particularly interesting. They handle the creation of file records in the Supabase "files" table, but they also handle the extraction of raw text from .docx files using Mammoth.js, and the association of files with workspaces in the "file_workspaces" table. They also handle the uploading of the file to a storage service, and the processing of the file using an API endpoint. If any of these steps fail, they display a toast notification and delete the file record from the "files" table.
