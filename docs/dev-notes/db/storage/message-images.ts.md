This TypeScript file is part of a larger project that uses Supabase, an open-source Firebase alternative. It provides two exported functions: `uploadMessageImage` and `getMessageImageFromStorage`. These functions are used to upload and retrieve images from a Supabase storage bucket named "message_images".

## `uploadMessageImage(path: string, image: File)`

This asynchronous function is used to upload an image to the "message_images" bucket in Supabase storage. It takes two parameters:

- `path`: A string representing the path where the image will be stored.
- `image`: A File object representing the image to be uploaded.

The function first checks if the size of the image is less than 6MB. If the image size exceeds this limit, it throws an error. Then, it attempts to upload the image to the specified path in the bucket. If there's an error during the upload, it throws an error. If the upload is successful, it returns the path where the image was stored.

## `getMessageImageFromStorage(filePath: string)`

This asynchronous function is used to retrieve a signed URL for an image from the "message_images" bucket in Supabase storage. It takes one parameter:

- `filePath`: A string representing the path of the image in the storage bucket.

The function attempts to create a signed URL for the image, which remains valid for 24 hours. If there's an error during this process, it throws an error. If the process is successful, it returns the signed URL.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in a context where users need to upload images to be associated with messages, and then retrieve these images at a later time. The `uploadMessageImage` function would be used when a user uploads an image, and the `getMessageImageFromStorage` function would be used when that image needs to be displayed or downloaded.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `uploadMessageImage` function uses the `upsert` option when uploading the image. This means that if an image already exists at the specified path, it will be replaced with the new image. This could be useful in a scenario where users are allowed to update the images associated with their messages.

The `getMessageImageFromStorage` function creates a signed URL that is valid for 24 hours. This could be a security measure to ensure that access to the image is temporary and has to be explicitly requested.
