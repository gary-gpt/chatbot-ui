# workspaceImage.ts

This TypeScript file, `workspaceImage.ts`, is part of a project that uses Supabase, a web-based platform that provides real-time databases, authentication, and storage. This file specifically handles the uploading and retrieval of workspace images.

## Exports

This file exports two asynchronous functions: `uploadWorkspaceImage` and `getWorkspaceImageFromStorage`.

### uploadWorkspaceImage

The `uploadWorkspaceImage` function is used to upload an image file to a specific workspace. It takes two arguments: `workspace` and `image`. 

- `workspace` is an object of type `Tables<"workspaces">`. This object represents a workspace in the database.
- `image` is a `File` object representing the image to be uploaded.

The function first checks if the size of the image exceeds the limit of 6MB. If it does, it throws an error. 

It then checks if there is an existing image in the workspace. If there is, it deletes the old image before uploading the new one. 

The function then uploads the image to the Supabase storage, specifically to the `workspace_images` bucket. The path of the image in the storage is determined by the `user_id` and `id` of the workspace and the current timestamp. 

If there is an error during the deletion of the old image or the uploading of the new image, the function throws an error. 

The function returns the file path of the uploaded image.

### getWorkspaceImageFromStorage

The `getWorkspaceImageFromStorage` function is used to retrieve a workspace image from the Supabase storage. It takes one argument: `filePath`, which is a string representing the path of the image in the storage.

The function tries to create a signed URL for the image in the `workspace_images` bucket. The signed URL is valid for 24 hours. 

If there is an error during the creation of the signed URL, the function throws an error. 

The function returns the signed URL of the image.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in a larger system where users can upload images to their workspaces and retrieve them. The `uploadWorkspaceImage` function would be used when a user uploads a new image, and the `getWorkspaceImageFromStorage` function would be used when a user wants to view an image.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `uploadWorkspaceImage` function uses the `upsert` option when uploading the image. This means that if an image with the same path already exists in the storage, it will be replaced by the new image. This is useful in this context because it allows for easy updating of the workspace image. 

The `getWorkspaceImageFromStorage` function uses a signed URL to retrieve the image. This is a secure way of providing access to the image because the URL is only valid for a limited time.
