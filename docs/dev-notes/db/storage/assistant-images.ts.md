# `assistantImage.ts`

This TypeScript file is part of a project that uses Supabase, a Firebase-like development platform. It provides functionality for uploading and retrieving assistant images from a Supabase storage bucket.

## Exports

The file exports two functions: `uploadAssistantImage` and `getAssistantImageFromStorage`.

### `uploadAssistantImage`

This asynchronous function takes two parameters: `assistant` and `image`. 

- `assistant` is an object of type `Tables<"assistants">`, which is a type from the `Tables` type defined in the `@/supabase/types` module.
- `image` is an instance of the `File` object, representing the image to be uploaded.

The function uploads the image to the `assistant_images` bucket in Supabase storage. Before uploading, it checks if the image size exceeds the limit of 6MB. If it does, an error is thrown. 

If the assistant already has an image (determined by checking `assistant.image_path`), the function deletes the old image from the storage before uploading the new one. 

The function returns the file path of the uploaded image.

### `getAssistantImageFromStorage`

This asynchronous function takes a single parameter: `filePath`, which is a string representing the path of the image in the storage.

The function retrieves the image from the `assistant_images` bucket in Supabase storage and creates a signed URL for the image that is valid for 24 hours. If an error occurs during this process, it throws an error and logs it to the console.

The function returns the signed URL of the image.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in a context where an assistant's image needs to be uploaded to a storage bucket and later retrieved. The `uploadAssistantImage` function would be used when a new image is uploaded or an existing image is updated. The `getAssistantImageFromStorage` function would be used when the image needs to be displayed.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The file makes use of the Supabase client for browser, which is imported from `@/lib/supabase/browser-client`. This indicates that these functions are likely used on the client side of the application.

The `uploadAssistantImage` function uses the `upsert` option when uploading the image. This means that if a file with the same path already exists in the storage, it will be replaced with the new file. This is useful for updating an assistant's image.

The `getAssistantImageFromStorage` function creates a signed URL for the image, which provides secure, temporary access to the image. This is a good practice for protecting sensitive resources.
