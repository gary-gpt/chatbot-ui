# uploadProfileImage.ts

This TypeScript file is a part of a project that uses Supabase, a Firebase alternative. It exports a single async function `uploadProfileImage` that is used to upload a profile image to a Supabase storage bucket.

## Function: uploadProfileImage

The `uploadProfileImage` function takes two parameters: `profile` and `image`. 

- `profile` is an object of type `Tables<"profiles">`, which is a type exported from the `@/supabase/types` module. This object represents a user profile and contains user information.
- `image` is a `File` object representing the image to be uploaded.

The function first checks if the size of the image exceeds the limit (2MB). If it does, an error is thrown.

If the profile already has an image (the `image_path` property of the profile object is not empty), the function deletes the old image from the storage bucket.

The function then uploads the new image to the storage bucket. If the upload fails, an error is thrown.

Finally, the function retrieves the public URL of the uploaded image and returns an object containing the path of the image in the storage bucket and its public URL.

### Usage

This function is likely used when a user updates their profile picture. The function would be called with the user's profile and the new image file as arguments.

### Interesting Structure or Nuance

The function uses the `supabase.storage.from(bucket)` method to interact with the storage bucket. This method returns a `Bucket` object, which provides methods for uploading, deleting, and retrieving files.

The `upload` method is used with the `upsert` option set to `true`. This means that if a file with the same path already exists in the bucket, it will be replaced with the new file.

The `remove` method is used to delete the old image. It takes an array of paths to delete, but in this case, only one path is provided.

The `getPublicUrl` method is used to retrieve the public URL of the uploaded image. This URL can be used to display the image in a web page.

The function uses `async/await` syntax to handle the asynchronous operations. This makes the code easier to read and understand, as it avoids callback hell and makes error handling simpler.
