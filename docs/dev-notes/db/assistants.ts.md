# Source File Documentation

## Original Filename: Unknown

This file is a TypeScript module that provides a set of functions to interact with a Supabase database. Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative. The functions in this file are used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on two tables in the database: `assistants` and `assistant_workspaces`.

### Exports

This file exports several functions:

- `getAssistantById(assistantId: string)`: This function retrieves an assistant from the `assistants` table by their ID. It returns a Promise that resolves to the assistant data or throws an error if the assistant is not found.

- `getAssistantWorkspacesByWorkspaceId(workspaceId: string)`: This function retrieves a workspace from the `workspaces` table by its ID, including the assistants associated with that workspace. It returns a Promise that resolves to the workspace data or throws an error if the workspace is not found.

- `getAssistantWorkspacesByAssistantId(assistantId: string)`: This function retrieves an assistant from the `assistants` table by their ID, including the workspaces associated with that assistant. It returns a Promise that resolves to the assistant data or throws an error if the assistant is not found.

- `createAssistant(assistant: TablesInsert<"assistants">, workspace_id: string)`: This function creates a new assistant in the `assistants` table and associates it with a workspace in the `assistant_workspaces` table. It returns a Promise that resolves to the created assistant data or throws an error if the creation fails.

- `createAssistants(assistants: TablesInsert<"assistants">[], workspace_id: string)`: This function creates multiple new assistants in the `assistants` table and associates them with a workspace in the `assistant_workspaces` table. It returns a Promise that resolves to the created assistants data or throws an error if the creation fails.

- `createAssistantWorkspace(item: { user_id: string, assistant_id: string, workspace_id: string })`: This function creates a new association between an assistant and a workspace in the `assistant_workspaces` table. It returns a Promise that resolves to the created association data or throws an error if the creation fails.

- `createAssistantWorkspaces(items: { user_id: string; assistant_id: string; workspace_id: string }[])`: This function creates multiple new associations between assistants and a workspace in the `assistant_workspaces` table. It returns a Promise that resolves to the created associations data or throws an error if the creation fails.

- `updateAssistant(assistantId: string, assistant: TablesUpdate<"assistants">)`: This function updates an existing assistant in the `assistants` table. It returns a Promise that resolves to the updated assistant data or throws an error if the update fails.

- `deleteAssistant(assistantId: string)`: This function deletes an assistant from the `assistants` table. It returns a Promise that resolves to `true` or throws an error if the deletion fails.

- `deleteAssistantWorkspace(assistantId: string, workspaceId: string)`: This function deletes an association between an assistant and a workspace from the `assistant_workspaces` table. It returns a Promise that resolves to `true` or throws an error if the deletion fails.

### Usage

These functions can be imported and used in other parts of the application to interact with the Supabase database. For example, to retrieve an assistant by their ID, you would use the `getAssistantById` function:

```typescript
import { getAssistantById } from './this-file'

const assistantId = 'some-id'
getAssistantById(assistantId)
  .then(assistant => console.log(assistant))
  .catch(error => console.error(error))
```

### Interesting Structure or Nuance

The functions in this file make use of the Supabase JavaScript client to interact with the database. They use the `from` method to specify the table to interact with, and then chain other methods like `select`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `eq`, and `single` to build and execute the database query.

The `TablesInsert` and `TablesUpdate` types are imported from another module and used to type the `assistant` parameter in the `createAssistant`, `createAssistants`, and `updateAssistant` functions. These types likely define the shape of an assistant object for insertion or update in the `assistants` table.
