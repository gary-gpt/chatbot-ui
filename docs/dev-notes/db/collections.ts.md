# collections.ts

This TypeScript file, `collections.ts`, is a module that provides a set of functions to interact with a Supabase database. It is primarily concerned with performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the `collections` and `collection_workspaces` tables in the database.

## Exports

The file exports several functions, each of which performs a specific operation on the database. All functions are asynchronous and return a Promise.

### getCollectionById(collectionId: string)

This function retrieves a single collection from the `collections` table by its `id`. It throws an error if the collection is not found.

### getCollectionWorkspacesByWorkspaceId(workspaceId: string)

This function retrieves a single workspace from the `workspaces` table by its `id`, along with its associated collections. It throws an error if the workspace is not found.

### getCollectionWorkspacesByCollectionId(collectionId: string)

This function retrieves a single collection from the `collections` table by its `id`, along with its associated workspaces. It throws an error if the collection is not found.

### createCollection(collection: TablesInsert<"collections">, workspace_id: string)

This function inserts a new collection into the `collections` table and associates it with a workspace. It returns the created collection.

### createCollections(collections: TablesInsert<"collections">[], workspace_id: string)

This function inserts multiple new collections into the `collections` table and associates them with a workspace. It returns the created collections.

### createCollectionWorkspace(item: { user_id: string, collection_id: string, workspace_id: string })

This function inserts a new association between a collection and a workspace into the `collection_workspaces` table. It returns the created association.

### createCollectionWorkspaces(items: { user_id: string, collection_id: string, workspace_id: string }[])

This function inserts multiple new associations between collections and a workspace into the `collection_workspaces` table. It returns the created associations.

### updateCollection(collectionId: string, collection: TablesUpdate<"collections">)

This function updates a collection in the `collections` table. It returns the updated collection.

### deleteCollection(collectionId: string)

This function deletes a collection from the `collections` table. It returns `true` if the operation is successful.

### deleteCollectionWorkspace(collectionId: string, workspaceId: string)

This function deletes an association between a collection and a workspace from the `collection_workspaces` table. It returns `true` if the operation is successful.

## Usage

These functions are typically used in the context of a web application, where they would be called in response to user actions or to populate the user interface with data from the database.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The functions in this file make extensive use of the Supabase JavaScript client library to interact with the database. They also make use of TypeScript's type system to ensure that the data being inserted or updated in the database conforms to the expected shape.
