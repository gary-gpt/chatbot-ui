# profiles.ts

This TypeScript file is a module that provides functions for interacting with the `profiles` table in a Supabase database. Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a backend-as-a-service with a real-time database, authentication, and more. This module uses the Supabase JavaScript client to perform operations on the `profiles` table.

## Exports

This module exports five functions: `getProfileByUserId`, `getProfilesByUserId`, `createProfile`, `updateProfile`, and `deleteProfile`.

### getProfileByUserId

This function takes a user ID as a string and returns a promise that resolves to the profile associated with that user ID. If no profile is found, it throws an error.

### getProfilesByUserId

This function is similar to `getProfileByUserId`, but it returns all profiles associated with the given user ID, not just one. If no profiles are found, it throws an error.

### createProfile

This function takes a profile object of type `TablesInsert<"profiles">` and returns a promise that resolves to the created profile. If there is an error during creation, it throws an error.

### updateProfile

This function takes a profile ID as a string and a profile object of type `TablesUpdate<"profiles">`. It returns a promise that resolves to the updated profile. If there is an error during the update, it throws an error.

### deleteProfile

This function takes a profile ID as a string and deletes the corresponding profile. If there is an error during deletion, it throws an error. If the deletion is successful, it returns `true`.

## Usage

To use these functions, you would import them from the module and then call them with the appropriate arguments. For example:

```typescript
import { createProfile } from './profiles'

const newProfile = {
  user_id: '123',
  name: 'John Doe',
  // other profile properties...
}

createProfile(newProfile)
  .then(profile => console.log('Created profile:', profile))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error creating profile:', error))
```

## Structure and Nuance

Each function in this module uses the Supabase client to perform a database operation. The client's fluent API is used to build up the operation, and then `await` is used to perform the operation and wait for the result. If the operation results in an error, the function throws an error with the error message from Supabase. If the operation is successful, the function returns the result.
