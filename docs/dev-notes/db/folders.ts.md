# Source File: Folders.js

This source file is a part of a JavaScript/TypeScript project that interacts with a Supabase database. It provides functions to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the 'folders' table in the database. 

## Exports

This file exports four asynchronous functions:

### getFoldersByWorkspaceId(workspaceId: string)

This function retrieves all folders that belong to a specific workspace, identified by the `workspaceId`. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of folders. If no folders are found, it throws an error.

### createFolder(folder: TablesInsert<"folders">)

This function creates a new folder in the database. It takes a `TablesInsert` object as an argument, which should represent the new folder to be created. It returns a promise that resolves to the created folder. If there's an error during the creation, it throws an error.

### updateFolder(folderId: string, folder: TablesUpdate<"folders">)

This function updates an existing folder in the database. It takes a `folderId` and a `TablesUpdate` object as arguments. The `folderId` identifies the folder to be updated, and the `TablesUpdate` object should represent the new state of the folder. It returns a promise that resolves to the updated folder. If there's an error during the update, it throws an error.

### deleteFolder(folderId: string)

This function deletes a folder from the database. It takes a `folderId` as an argument, which identifies the folder to be deleted. It returns a promise that resolves to `true` if the deletion is successful. If there's an error during the deletion, it throws an error.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in the context of a server-side application, where they would be called to perform operations on the 'folders' table in response to HTTP requests. For example, the `getFoldersByWorkspaceId` function might be called when a GET request is made to an endpoint like `/workspaces/:id/folders`.

## Structure and Nuance

The functions in this file make use of the Supabase JavaScript client to interact with the database. Each function begins by calling a method on the `supabase` object to specify the 'folders' table, then chains additional methods to build up a database query.

The `TablesInsert` and `TablesUpdate` types are likely defined elsewhere in the project, and are used to ensure that the `folder` objects passed to the `createFolder` and `updateFolder` functions have the correct shape.
