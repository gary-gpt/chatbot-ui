# chats.ts

This TypeScript file is a module that provides functions for interacting with the "chats" table in a Supabase database. Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides real-time updates, user authentication, and database management.

## Exports

The module exports the following functions:

### getChatById(chatId: string)

This function retrieves a chat record by its ID. It returns a promise that resolves to the chat record or `null` if no chat with the given ID exists.

### getChatsByWorkspaceId(workspaceId: string)

This function retrieves all chat records associated with a given workspace ID. The chats are ordered by their creation time in descending order. If no chats are found, it throws an error.

### createChat(chat: TablesInsert<"chats">)

This function creates a new chat record. It takes an object that matches the structure of a chat record and returns a promise that resolves to the created chat record. If an error occurs during creation, it throws an error.

### createChats(chats: TablesInsert<"chats">[])

This function creates multiple new chat records. It takes an array of objects that match the structure of a chat record and returns a promise that resolves to the array of created chat records. If an error occurs during creation, it throws an error.

### updateChat(chatId: string, chat: TablesUpdate<"chats">)

This function updates a chat record. It takes a chat ID and an object that contains the fields to be updated. It returns a promise that resolves to the updated chat record. If an error occurs during the update, it throws an error.

### deleteChat(chatId: string)

This function deletes a chat record by its ID. It returns a promise that resolves to `true` if the deletion was successful. If an error occurs during deletion, it throws an error.

## Usage

These functions are used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the "chats" table in the Supabase database. They are likely used in the context of a chat application where users can create, read, update, and delete chat messages.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The functions in this module make use of the `supabase` client to interact with the Supabase database. They use the fluent API provided by the `supabase` client to construct SQL-like queries. The use of TypeScript's generic types in `TablesInsert<"chats">` and `TablesUpdate<"chats">` ensures type safety when creating and updating chat records.
