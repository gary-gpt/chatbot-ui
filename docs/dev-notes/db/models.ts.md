# models.ts

This TypeScript file provides a set of functions that interact with a Supabase database. The functions are used to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the `models` and `model_workspaces` tables in the database.

## Exports

### getModelById

This asynchronous function retrieves a model from the `models` table by its `id`. It returns the model if found, otherwise it throws an error.

### getModelWorkspacesByWorkspaceId

This asynchronous function retrieves a workspace from the `workspaces` table by its `id`, along with its associated models. It returns the workspace if found, otherwise it throws an error.

### getModelWorkspacesByModelId

This asynchronous function retrieves a model from the `models` table by its `id`, along with its associated workspaces. It returns the model if found, otherwise it throws an error.

### createModel

This asynchronous function creates a new model in the `models` table and a new entry in the `model_workspaces` table associating the model with a workspace. It returns the created model.

### createModels

This asynchronous function creates multiple new models in the `models` table and new entries in the `model_workspaces` table associating each model with a workspace. It returns the created models.

### createModelWorkspace

This asynchronous function creates a new entry in the `model_workspaces` table associating a model with a workspace. It returns the created entry.

### createModelWorkspaces

This asynchronous function creates multiple new entries in the `model_workspaces` table associating models with a workspace. It returns the created entries.

### updateModel

This asynchronous function updates a model in the `models` table by its `id`. It returns the updated model.

### deleteModel

This asynchronous function deletes a model from the `models` table by its `id`. It returns `true` if the operation is successful.

### deleteModelWorkspace

This asynchronous function deletes an entry from the `model_workspaces` table by the `model_id` and `workspace_id`. It returns `true` if the operation is successful.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in the context of a larger application where models and workspaces need to be managed. They provide the necessary operations to interact with the database.

## Structure and Nuance

The functions in this file make use of the Supabase JavaScript client to interact with the database. Each function performs a specific database operation, such as selecting, inserting, updating, or deleting data. The `TablesInsert` and `TablesUpdate` types are used to ensure the correct data structure when inserting or updating data. Errors from the database operations are handled by throwing JavaScript `Error` objects.
