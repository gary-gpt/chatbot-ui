# chatFiles.ts

This TypeScript file, `chatFiles.ts`, is a part of a larger project that interacts with a Supabase database. It provides functions to interact with the `chats` and `chat_files` tables in the database, specifically to retrieve and create chat files.

## Exports

The file exports three asynchronous functions:

### getChatFilesByChatId(chatId: string)

This function retrieves chat files associated with a specific chat ID from the `chats` table. It takes a `chatId` string as an argument and returns a promise that resolves to the chat files data.

The function uses the Supabase client to select the `id`, `name`, and `files` fields from the `chats` table where the `id` equals the provided `chatId`. If no chat files are found, it throws an error with the message from the Supabase error.

### createChatFile(chatFile: TablesInsert<"chat_files">)

This function creates a new chat file in the `chat_files` table. It takes a `chatFile` object as an argument, which should match the `TablesInsert<"chat_files">` type. The function returns a promise that resolves to the created chat file data.

The function uses the Supabase client to insert the `chatFile` into the `chat_files` table and then selects all fields of the newly created chat file. If the chat file creation fails, it throws an error with the message from the Supabase error.

### createChatFiles(chatFiles: TablesInsert<"chat_files">[])

This function creates multiple new chat files in the `chat_files` table. It takes an array of `chatFiles` objects as an argument, each of which should match the `TablesInsert<"chat_files">` type. The function returns a promise that resolves to the created chat files data.

The function uses the Supabase client to insert the `chatFiles` into the `chat_files` table and then selects all fields of the newly created chat files. If the chat files creation fails, it throws an error with the message from the Supabase error.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in the context of a chat application where files can be shared in chats. The `getChatFilesByChatId` function would be used to retrieve the files for a specific chat, while the `createChatFile` and `createChatFiles` functions would be used to add new files to a chat.

## Structure and Nuance

The structure of these functions is very similar, each using the Supabase client to interact with the database and throwing an error if the operation fails. The main difference is in the specific database operation being performed (selecting vs inserting) and the table being interacted with (`chats` vs `chat_files`).
