# Source File Documentation: Presets and Workspaces

This file is a collection of functions that interact with a Supabase database. The file exports several functions that perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on two tables in the database: `presets` and `workspaces`. 

## Exports

### getPresetById(presetId: string)

This function retrieves a preset from the `presets` table by its `id`. It returns the preset if found, otherwise, it throws an error.

### getPresetWorkspacesByWorkspaceId(workspaceId: string)

This function retrieves a workspace from the `workspaces` table by its `id`, along with its associated presets. It returns the workspace if found, otherwise, it throws an error.

### getPresetWorkspacesByPresetId(presetId: string)

This function retrieves a preset from the `presets` table by its `id`, along with its associated workspaces. It returns the preset if found, otherwise, it throws an error.

### createPreset(preset: TablesInsert<"presets">, workspace_id: string)

This function creates a new preset in the `presets` table and associates it with a workspace. It returns the created preset.

### createPresets(presets: TablesInsert<"presets">[], workspace_id: string)

This function creates multiple presets in the `presets` table and associates them with a workspace. It returns the created presets.

### createPresetWorkspace(item: { user_id: string, preset_id: string, workspace_id: string })

This function creates a new association between a preset and a workspace in the `preset_workspaces` table. It returns the created association.

### createPresetWorkspaces(items: { user_id: string; preset_id: string; workspace_id: string }[])

This function creates multiple associations between presets and a workspace in the `preset_workspaces` table. It returns the created associations.

### updatePreset(presetId: string, preset: TablesUpdate<"presets">)

This function updates a preset in the `presets` table by its `id`. It returns the updated preset.

### deletePreset(presetId: string)

This function deletes a preset from the `presets` table by its `id`. It returns `true` if the deletion was successful.

### deletePresetWorkspace(presetId: string, workspaceId: string)

This function deletes an association between a preset and a workspace from the `preset_workspaces` table using their `ids`. It returns `true` if the deletion was successful.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in the context of a larger application where presets and workspaces need to be managed. They provide the necessary operations to interact with the `presets` and `workspaces` tables in the Supabase database.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The functions in this file make extensive use of the Supabase JavaScript client to interact with the database. They also use TypeScript for static type checking, which helps ensure that the data being passed to and returned from the functions is of the expected type. 

The functions that create and update records in the database return the created or updated record, which can be useful for confirming that the operation was successful and for displaying the new or updated data to the user. The delete functions, on the other hand, return `true` to indicate success, but they do not return the deleted data.
