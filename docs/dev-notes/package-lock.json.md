# File: `/chatbot-ui/package-lock.json`

## Purpose

This file is automatically generated by `npm` to **lock the exact versions** of all dependencies and sub-dependencies at the time of installation.

It ensures:
- Consistent dependency trees across environments
- Reliable and reproducible builds
- Faster installs via resolved version caching

## Key Elements

### `lockfileVersion: 3`
- Indicates the file format version (used by npm v7+).
- Enables support for workspaces and peer dependency handling improvements.

### `packages`
- Lists every package in the dependency graph â€” not just direct dependencies, but all nested ones.
- Includes metadata such as version, resolved URLs, integrity hashes, and install paths.

### Top-Level `dependencies`
A snippet from your project:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "next": "13.4.7",
  "react": "18.2.0",
  "tailwindcss": "3.3.2"
}
