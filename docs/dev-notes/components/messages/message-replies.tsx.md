# MessageReplies.tsx

This TypeScript file defines a component named `MessageReplies` that is used to display a message reply interface. The interface includes a trigger to open a sheet (a type of modal or dialog), and the sheet contains a warning message about a permanent action.

## Exports

The file exports a single component, `MessageReplies`.

### MessageReplies

`MessageReplies` is a functional component that doesn't take any props. It uses the `useState` hook from React to manage the state of the sheet (whether it's open or closed).

When clicked, the trigger (an icon with a tooltip) opens the sheet. The sheet contains a title and a description warning the user about a permanent action. The exact nature of this action is not specified in this file, but the wording suggests it could be related to deleting a user account.

## Components and Libraries

The file uses several components from the `@tabler/icons-react` and `../ui` libraries:

- `IconMessage`: An icon from the `@tabler/icons-react` library.
- `Sheet`, `SheetContent`, `SheetHeader`, `SheetTitle`, `SheetDescription`, `SheetTrigger`: Components from the `../ui/sheet` module that are used to build the sheet interface.
- `WithTooltip`: A component from the `../ui/with-tooltip` module that wraps the trigger and provides a tooltip.

## Constants

The file also uses a constant, `MESSAGE_ICON_SIZE`, which is imported from `./message-actions`. This constant likely defines the size of the `IconMessage`.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `MessageReplies` component uses the `asChild` prop on `SheetTrigger`, which suggests that the trigger is a child component of the sheet. This is an interesting structure because it allows the trigger to control the state of the sheet (whether it's open or closed).

The trigger also has a `notification-indicator` that displays the number `1`. This could indicate that there's one new reply, but without more context, it's hard to say for sure.

The tooltip on the trigger has a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) and is displayed at the bottom of the trigger. The tooltip's display content is a `div` with the text "View Replies".
