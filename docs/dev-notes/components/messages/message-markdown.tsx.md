# MessageMarkdown.tsx

This TypeScript file is a part of a React project and it exports a functional component named `MessageMarkdown`. This component is used to render markdown content with support for GitHub flavored markdown (GFM) and mathematical expressions.

## Exports

The file exports a single functional component `MessageMarkdown`.

### MessageMarkdown

This is a functional component that takes a single prop `content` which is a string of markdown content. It uses the `MessageMarkdownMemoized` component to render the markdown content with some customizations.

The component uses two plugins, `remarkGfm` and `remarkMath`, to support GitHub flavored markdown and mathematical expressions respectively.

The component also customizes the rendering of `p`, `img`, and `code` elements:

- `p`: Paragraphs are given a bottom margin of 2, except for the last paragraph.
- `img`: Images are given a maximum width of 67%.
- `code`: Code blocks are handled in a special way. If the first child of the code block is a string and does not include a newline character, it is rendered as an inline code block. Otherwise, it is rendered as a block of code using the `MessageCodeBlock` component. If the first child is a special character "‚ñç", it is rendered as a pulsating cursor.

## Types

### MessageMarkdownProps

This is an interface that describes the props of the `MessageMarkdown` component. It has a single property `content` which is a string.

## Usage

The `MessageMarkdown` component can be used in a React application like this:

```jsx
<MessageMarkdown content="**Hello, world!**" />
```

This will render the string "Hello, world!" as bold text, because the content is interpreted as markdown.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `MessageMarkdown` component uses the `MessageMarkdownMemoized` component to render the markdown content. This suggests that the rendering of the markdown content is potentially an expensive operation and the result is memoized for performance reasons.

The handling of the `code` element is quite complex. It checks the type and content of the first child to determine how to render the code block. It also uses a regular expression to extract the language of the code block from the class name. This allows the `MessageCodeBlock` component to syntax highlight the code block according to its language.
