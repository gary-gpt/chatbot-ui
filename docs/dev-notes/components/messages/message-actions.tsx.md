# MessageActions.tsx

This file is a part of a chatbot UI and provides the functionality for different actions that can be performed on a message in the chat interface. These actions include copying, editing, and regenerating a message. The file is written in TypeScript and uses React for creating the UI components.

## Exports

The file exports two entities:

1. `MESSAGE_ICON_SIZE`: A constant that defines the size of the icons used in the message actions.

2. `MessageActions`: A functional component that renders the actions that can be performed on a message.

## Types

The file defines a TypeScript interface `MessageActionsProps` which is used to type the props for the `MessageActions` component. The interface includes:

- `isAssistant`: A boolean indicating if the current user is an assistant.
- `isLast`: A boolean indicating if the current message is the last one.
- `isEditing`: A boolean indicating if the current message is being edited.
- `isHovering`: A boolean indicating if the mouse is hovering over the current message.
- `onCopy`: A function to be called when the copy action is triggered.
- `onEdit`: A function to be called when the edit action is triggered.
- `onRegenerate`: A function to be called when the regenerate action is triggered.

## Usage

The `MessageActions` component is likely used in a larger chat interface where each message has the option to be copied, edited, or regenerated. The component uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to determine if a message is being generated.

The component also maintains a local state `showCheckmark` which is used to show a checkmark icon after a message has been copied. This state is reset after 2 seconds.

The component returns a set of icons wrapped in a `WithTooltip` component. The tooltip shows the action name when the icon is hovered over. The icons and their actions are conditionally rendered based on the props and the context.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The component has a commented out section for a "Fork Chat" action and a "Message Replies" feature. These could be features that are planned for future implementation.

The `handleCopy` function not only triggers the `onCopy` prop function but also sets the `showCheckmark` state to true. This is an interesting way to give immediate visual feedback to the user that the copy action was successful.

The `handleForkChat` function is currently empty, suggesting that the functionality for this action is yet to be implemented.
