# Message.tsx

This file is a React component that represents a single message in a chat interface. It handles both user and assistant messages, as well as system prompts. The message component includes features for editing, copying, and regenerating messages. It also handles the display of associated files and images.

## Exports

The file exports a single component, `Message`, which is a functional component in React.

## Types

The `MessageProps` interface defines the props that the `Message` component accepts:

- `message`: The message to be displayed.
- `fileItems`: An array of file items associated with the message.
- `isEditing`: A boolean indicating whether the message is currently being edited.
- `isLast`: A boolean indicating whether the message is the last one in the chat.
- `onStartEdit`: A function to be called when the user starts editing the message.
- `onCancelEdit`: A function to be called when the user cancels editing the message.
- `onSubmitEdit`: A function to be called when the user submits the edited message.

## Usage

The `Message` component is likely used in a list or array of messages in a chat interface. The parent component would pass in the necessary props, including the message data and handlers for editing the message.

## Structure

The `Message` component uses several hooks and context to manage its state and side effects. It uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to access various pieces of state related to the chat interface, such as the user's profile, the selected assistant, and the current tool in use.

The component also uses several local state variables to manage its own state, such as whether the message is being hovered over, the current edited message text, and whether the image or file item preview is shown.

The component is structured into several sections, including the message actions, the message content, the file items, and the image previews. Each section is conditionally rendered based on the state of the component and the props passed in.

## Interesting Nuances

The `Message` component handles several different types of messages, including user messages, assistant messages, and system prompts. It also handles different states of a message, such as when it's being edited or regenerated.

The component also includes several interesting features, such as the ability to copy a message to the clipboard, edit a message, and regenerate a message. It also includes a preview feature for images and file items associated with a message.

The component uses several custom hooks and components, such as `useChatHandler`, `TextareaAutosize`, and `FilePreview`, which abstract away some of the complexity and make the component easier to understand.
