# ModelSelect.tsx

This TypeScript file is part of a chatbot UI and is responsible for rendering a dropdown menu that allows users to select a model from a list of available models. The models can be filtered by provider and searched by name.

## Exports

The file exports a single component, `ModelSelect`.

### ModelSelect

`ModelSelect` is a functional component that receives props of type `ModelSelectProps`.

#### Props

- `selectedModelId`: A string representing the ID of the currently selected model.
- `onSelectModel`: A function that is called when a model is selected. It receives the ID of the selected model as an argument.

#### Usage

The `ModelSelect` component is used to render a dropdown menu of available models. The dropdown menu includes a search input and tabs for filtering models by provider. When a model is selected, the `onSelectModel` function is called with the ID of the selected model.

The component uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to access the current user's profile and the available models. The models are grouped by provider and can be filtered by the selected tab and the search input.

The dropdown menu is opened and closed by clicking on the trigger button. When the menu is opened, the search input is automatically focused. This is achieved with a `useEffect` hook that runs when the `isOpen` state changes.

The selected model is displayed on the trigger button. If no model is selected, the button displays "Select a model". If no models are available, the button is disabled and displays a message instructing the user to enter API keys in their profile settings.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The component uses several custom hooks and components, such as `useContext`, `useRef`, `useState`, `useEffect`, `DropdownMenu`, `DropdownMenuTrigger`, `DropdownMenuContent`, `Tabs`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, `Input`, `Button`, `ModelIcon`, and `ModelOption`.

The `ModelSelect` component is structured in a way that it handles both the UI and the logic for selecting a model. This includes grouping the models by provider, filtering the models based on the selected tab and the search input, and handling the selection of a model.

The component also handles the opening and closing of the dropdown menu, including focusing the search input when the menu is opened. This is done in a somewhat hacky way with a `setTimeout` in a `useEffect` hook.
