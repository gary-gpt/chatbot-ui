# ModelOption.tsx

This TypeScript file is a part of a React project. It exports a single functional component, `ModelOption`, which is used to display information about a specific model in a tooltip when hovered over.

## Exports

### `ModelOption`

`ModelOption` is a functional component that takes in `ModelOptionProps` as props. It uses the `WithTooltip` component to display a tooltip when the user hovers over the model's name and icon. The tooltip displays the input and output cost of the model, if they exist and if the model's provider is not "ollama". 

The component also uses the `ModelIcon` component to display the icon of the model's provider.

## Types

### `ModelOptionProps`

`ModelOptionProps` is an interface that defines the props for the `ModelOption` component. It has two properties:

- `model`: An object of type `LLM` which contains information about the model.
- `onSelect`: A function that is called when the user clicks on the model's name and icon.

## Usage

The `ModelOption` component is likely used in a list or grid of models. When the user hovers over a model's name and icon, a tooltip appears displaying the model's input and output cost. When the user clicks on the model's name and icon, the `onSelect` function is called.

## Structure and Nuance

The `ModelOption` component uses conditional rendering to only display the model's input and output cost if they exist and if the model's provider is not "ollama". This is done using the `&&` operator in the JSX.

The component also uses the `ModelIcon` component to display the icon of the model's provider. This is likely a separate component to allow for different icons for different providers.

The `onSelect` function is called when the user clicks on the model's name and icon. This could be used to select the model or display more information about it.
