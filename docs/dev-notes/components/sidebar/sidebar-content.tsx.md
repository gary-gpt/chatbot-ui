# SidebarContent.tsx

This TypeScript file defines and exports a functional React component called `SidebarContent`. This component is used to render a sidebar that includes a search bar, a list of data, and create buttons. The sidebar's content can be filtered based on a search term.

## Exports

### `SidebarContent`

This is a functional component that takes in `SidebarContentProps` as props. It uses the `useState` hook from React to manage the state of the search term.

#### Props

- `contentType`: This is of type `ContentType` and it is used to determine the type of content that the sidebar will handle.
- `data`: This is of type `DataListType` and it represents the list of data that will be displayed in the sidebar.
- `folders`: This is an array of `Tables<"folders">` type. It represents the folders that will be displayed in the sidebar.

#### Usage

The `SidebarContent` component is used to render a sidebar with a search bar, create buttons, and a list of data. The data can be filtered based on the search term. The `contentType` prop is passed to the `SidebarCreateButtons` and `SidebarSearch` components to determine the type of content they will handle. The `data` prop is used to determine if there is any data and to filter the data based on the search term. The `folders` prop is passed to the `SidebarDataList` component to display the folders in the sidebar.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `SidebarContent` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the search term. It also uses the `filter` method to filter the data based on the search term. The filtered data is then passed to the `SidebarDataList` component.

The `SidebarContent` component also uses the `calc` CSS function to calculate the maximum height of the sidebar. This is done to subtract 50px from the total height for the workspace settings.

The `SidebarContent` component is structured in a way that it is divided into three main parts: the create buttons, the search bar, and the data list. Each part is rendered by a separate component (`SidebarCreateButtons`, `SidebarSearch`, and `SidebarDataList` respectively).
