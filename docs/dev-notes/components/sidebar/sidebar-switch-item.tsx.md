# SidebarSwitchItem.tsx

This TypeScript file defines and exports a functional component `SidebarSwitchItem` for a React application. The component is designed to be a part of a sidebar, specifically an item that can be switched or toggled.

## Exports

The file exports a single functional component `SidebarSwitchItem`.

### SidebarSwitchItem

`SidebarSwitchItem` is a functional component that takes in an object of `SidebarSwitchItemProps` as its props. The component returns a `WithTooltip` component that wraps a `TabsTrigger` component.

The `WithTooltip` component displays the `contentType` prop in a div, with the first letter capitalized. The `TabsTrigger` component takes in the `contentType` as its value and an `onClick` handler that triggers the `onContentTypeChange` function with the `contentType` as its argument. The `TabsTrigger` component also displays the `icon` prop.

## Types

### SidebarSwitchItemProps

This is an interface that defines the props for the `SidebarSwitchItem` component. It includes:

- `contentType`: A `ContentType` value that represents the type of content the sidebar item is associated with.
- `icon`: A `ReactNode` that represents the icon to be displayed for the sidebar item.
- `onContentTypeChange`: A function that takes in a `ContentType` value and returns `void`. This function is triggered when the sidebar item is clicked.

## Usage

This component is likely used in a sidebar or a similar UI component where multiple items can be toggled or switched. When a `SidebarSwitchItem` is clicked, it triggers the `onContentTypeChange` function, likely changing the content displayed in another part of the application.

## Nuances

The `SidebarSwitchItem` component uses the `WithTooltip` and `TabsTrigger` components from the `ui` directory, indicating a modular structure where smaller UI components are composed to create more complex ones.

The `className` prop of the `TabsTrigger` component suggests that the component's opacity changes on hover, indicating a visual feedback for user interaction. The `contentType` is also cast as `ContentType` when passed to the `onContentTypeChange` function, ensuring type safety.
