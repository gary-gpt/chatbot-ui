# File: FileItem.tsx

This TypeScript file is part of a larger project and is responsible for rendering a file item in a sidebar. It provides the functionality to view the file, edit the file name and description, and display file details such as type, size, and tokens.

## Exports

The file exports a single component `FileItem` and a helper function `formatFileSize`.

### `FileItem`

`FileItem` is a functional component that accepts `FileItemProps` as its props. `FileItemProps` is an interface that expects a `file` object of type `Tables<"files">`.

The `FileItem` component uses the `useState` hook from React to manage the state of the file's name and description. It also maintains a state `isTyping` to track if the user is currently typing.

The component renders a `SidebarItem` with various props including the file item, typing status, content type, icon, and state update. It also renders a function `renderInputs` that returns JSX for viewing the file, displaying file details, and inputs for editing the file's name and description.

The `getLinkAndView` function is used to fetch the file link from storage and open it in a new tab.

### `formatFileSize`

`formatFileSize` is a helper function that accepts a file size in bytes and returns a string representing the file size in a more readable format (KB, MB, or GB).

## Usage

The `FileItem` component can be used in any part of the application where a file item needs to be displayed in a sidebar with the ability to view the file and edit its name and description. The `formatFileSize` function can be used anywhere in the application where file size needs to be displayed in a human-readable format.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `FileItem` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the file's name and description. This allows the component to re-render and display the updated name and description whenever they are changed.

The `formatFileSize` function uses a series of `if` conditions to convert the file size from bytes to KB, MB, or GB as appropriate. This makes the file size easier to understand for users.
