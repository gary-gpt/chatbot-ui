# ToolItem.tsx

This TypeScript file defines and exports a functional component `ToolItem` which is used to display and manage a tool item in a sidebar. The tool item includes various properties such as name, description, URL, custom headers, and schema.

## Exports

The file exports a single functional component `ToolItem`. 

### `ToolItem`

This is a functional component that takes in `ToolItemProps` as props. The `ToolItemProps` interface expects a `tool` object of type `Tables<"tools">`.

The `ToolItem` component maintains its own state for the tool's name, description, URL, custom headers, and schema. It also maintains a state for whether the user is currently typing and any schema errors.

The component returns a `SidebarItem` component with the tool's properties and a set of input fields for editing these properties. The input fields are rendered conditionally based on the `renderInputs` function.

## Usage

The `ToolItem` component is likely used in a parent component where multiple tools are listed, such as a sidebar or a tool management page. The parent component would pass in the tool object as a prop to the `ToolItem` component.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `ToolItem` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the tool's properties. This allows the component to re-render whenever the user makes changes to the tool's properties.

The `ToolItem` component also uses the `validateOpenAPI` function to validate the tool's schema. If the schema is valid, the schema error state is cleared. If the schema is invalid, the schema error state is set to the error message. If the schema is not in valid JSON format, the schema error state is set to "Invalid JSON format".

The `ToolItem` component uses the `SidebarItem` component to display the tool's properties. The `SidebarItem` component likely provides a consistent layout and style for displaying items in a sidebar.

The file also contains commented out code for URL and other features, which might be planned for future implementation.
