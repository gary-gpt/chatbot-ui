# CreateCollection.tsx

This TypeScript file defines and exports a functional component `CreateCollection` which is used to create a new collection in a chatbot UI. The component is designed to be used within a sidebar, and it allows users to select files for the collection, and to provide a name and description for the collection.

## Exports

The file exports a single component, `CreateCollection`.

### `CreateCollection`

This is a functional component that takes in an object of `CreateCollectionProps` as its props. The `CreateCollectionProps` interface defines two properties:

- `isOpen`: A boolean indicating whether the component is currently open or not.
- `onOpenChange`: A function that is called when the open state of the component changes. It takes a boolean as its argument.

The `CreateCollection` component uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to access the user's profile and the currently selected workspace. If either of these are not available, the component returns `null`.

The component maintains its own state for the name and description of the new collection, whether the user is currently typing, and the files that have been selected for the new collection.

The `handleFileSelect` function is used to add or remove files from the selected files state.

The component returns a `SidebarCreateItem` component, passing in the necessary props and rendering inputs for the collection name, description, and file selection.

## Usage

The `CreateCollection` component is likely used within a sidebar in a chatbot UI. The `isOpen` and `onOpenChange` props would be controlled by the parent component, allowing it to control when the `CreateCollection` component is shown.

When the user selects files and enters a name and description for the new collection, this data is used to create a new collection when the `SidebarCreateItem` component's `createState` prop is used.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `handleFileSelect` function uses a functional update to update the `selectedCollectionFiles` state. This allows it to correctly handle adding or removing files from the state based on whether they have already been selected.

The `CreateCollection` component also uses the `TablesInsert<"collections">` type for its `createState` prop, indicating that it is used to insert a new collection into a database. The `user_id` and `file_id` for each selected file are included in this data, along with the collection name and description.
