# CollectionItem.tsx

This file defines and exports a functional component `CollectionItem` in a React application. The component is used to display and manage a collection item in a sidebar. It allows users to select files for the collection, and edit the collection's name and description.

## Imports

The file imports several components, constants, and types from various modules:

- UI components (`Input`, `Label`) from the local UI components directory.
- Database limits (`COLLECTION_DESCRIPTION_MAX`, `COLLECTION_NAME_MAX`) from the local database directory.
- Types (`Tables`, `CollectionFile`) from the local types directory.
- An icon (`IconBooks`) from the `@tabler/icons-react` package.
- React hooks (`FC`, `useState`) from the `react` package.
- Other components (`SidebarItem`, `CollectionFileSelect`) from the local directory.

## Interface

The file defines an interface `CollectionItemProps` which describes the props that the `CollectionItem` component expects. It includes a `collection` prop of type `Tables<"collections">`.

## Component

The `CollectionItem` component is a functional component that uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the collection's name, description, and whether the user is currently typing.

The component defines a `handleFileSelect` function that updates the selected files for the collection. It checks if a file is already selected, and if so, it removes it from the selection; otherwise, it adds the file to the selection.

The component returns a `SidebarItem` component with several props, including the collection item, the typing state, an icon, and an object containing the name and description state. It also provides a `renderInputs` function that returns the JSX for the file select, name input, and description input fields.

## Exports

The file exports the `CollectionItem` component.

## Usage

The `CollectionItem` component can be used in a parent component by importing it and passing a `collection` prop of type `Tables<"collections">`. The component handles all user interactions and state management internally, so no additional props or callbacks are needed.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `handleFileSelect` function uses a functional update to update the state based on the previous state. This is a common pattern in React when the new state depends on the previous state.

The `renderInputs` function uses a ternary operator to determine the selected files for the `CollectionFileSelect` component. It checks if any files are currently selected, and if not, it uses the starting files; otherwise, it combines the starting files and selected files, excluding any duplicates. This ensures that the file select always displays the correct files.
