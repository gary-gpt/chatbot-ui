# SidebarSwitcher.tsx

This TypeScript file is responsible for rendering the sidebar switcher in a user interface. The sidebar switcher is a component that allows users to switch between different content types in the application.

## Exports

The file exports two items:

1. `SIDEBAR_ICON_SIZE`: A constant that defines the size of the icons used in the sidebar.
2. `SidebarSwitcher`: A functional component that renders the sidebar switcher.

## Types

The file defines one interface:

- `SidebarSwitcherProps`: This interface defines the props for the `SidebarSwitcher` component. It has one function, `onContentTypeChange`, which is called when the user selects a different content type in the sidebar.

## Functions

The file contains one functional component:

- `SidebarSwitcher`: This component renders the sidebar switcher. It uses the `SidebarSwitchItem` component to render each item in the sidebar. Each item has an icon and represents a content type. When an item is clicked, the `onContentTypeChange` function is called with the selected content type.

## Usage

The `SidebarSwitcher` component is likely used in a layout or page component. It is used to allow users to switch between different content types in the application. The parent component should provide the `onContentTypeChange` function to handle the change in content type.

## Structure and Nuance

The `SidebarSwitcher` component uses the `TabsList` component to render the list of sidebar items. Each item is a `SidebarSwitchItem` component with an icon and a content type.

The component also includes a section for additional controls, such as profile settings. This section is currently commented out, indicating that it may be a work in progress.

The file imports several icon components from the `@tabler/icons-react` package. These icons are used to represent the different content types in the sidebar. The size of the icons is controlled by the `SIDEBAR_ICON_SIZE` constant.

The `ContentType` type is imported from a separate types file. This type is likely an enumeration of the different content types that the application supports.
