# SidebarSearch.tsx

This file defines and exports a functional component `SidebarSearch` for a sidebar search feature in a React application. This component is designed to be used in the context of a sidebar, where users can input search terms to filter content.

## Exports

The file exports a single component, `SidebarSearch`.

### SidebarSearch

`SidebarSearch` is a functional component from the React library. It uses TypeScript's `FC` (Functional Component) type with `SidebarSearchProps` as its props.

The component returns an `Input` component with a placeholder that changes based on the `contentType` prop, a value that is equal to the `searchTerm` prop, and an `onChange` event handler that updates the `searchTerm` when the user types into the input field.

## Types

### SidebarSearchProps

`SidebarSearchProps` is an interface that defines the props for the `SidebarSearch` component. It includes:

- `contentType`: A `ContentType` type imported from "@/types". This prop is used to customize the placeholder text in the `Input` component.
- `searchTerm`: A string that represents the current search term. This prop is used as the value for the `Input` component.
- `setSearchTerm`: A function that updates the `searchTerm`. This function is called whenever the `onChange` event is triggered in the `Input` component.

## Usage

To use the `SidebarSearch` component, import it from its module and include it in the JSX of the parent component. Pass the `contentType`, `searchTerm`, and `setSearchTerm` props to it.

```jsx
import { SidebarSearch } from './SidebarSearch';

//...

<SidebarSearch 
  contentType={yourContentType} 
  searchTerm={yourSearchTerm} 
  setSearchTerm={yourSetSearchTermFunction} 
/>
```

Where `yourContentType` is a variable of type `ContentType`, `yourSearchTerm` is a string variable representing the current search term, and `yourSetSearchTermFunction` is a function that updates the search term.

## Structure and Nuance

The `SidebarSearch` component is a simple, stateless functional component. It's interesting to note that the placeholder for the `Input` component is dynamically generated based on the `contentType` prop. This makes the component flexible and reusable for different content types.
