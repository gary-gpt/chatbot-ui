# ChatMessages.tsx

This file is a part of a chatbot application and it is responsible for rendering chat messages. It uses React and TypeScript, and it also leverages the context API for state management.

## Imports

The file imports several hooks, contexts, and types from different modules:

- `useChatHandler` from "@/components/chat/chat-hooks/use-chat-handler": This is a custom hook that provides functions for handling chat events.
- `ChatbotUIContext` from "@/context/context": This is the context that provides the state of the chatbot UI.
- `Tables` from "@/supabase/types": This is a type that represents the structure of tables in the Supabase database.
- `FC`, `useContext`, `useState` from "react": These are React hooks and types used in the component.
- `Message` from "../messages/message": This is a component that renders a single chat message.

## Interface

The file declares an empty `ChatMessagesProps` interface. This suggests that the `ChatMessages` component does not expect any props.

## Component

The file exports a functional component `ChatMessages`. This component fetches the chat messages and file items from the `ChatbotUIContext` and renders them using the `Message` component.

The `ChatMessages` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the message that is currently being edited.

The `chatMessages` are sorted by their sequence number and then mapped to the `Message` component. For each message, the corresponding file items are filtered from `chatFileItems`.

The `Message` component receives several props:

- `key`: The sequence number of the message.
- `message`: The message object.
- `fileItems`: The file items associated with the message.
- `isEditing`: A boolean indicating whether the message is being edited.
- `isLast`: A boolean indicating whether the message is the last one in the array.
- `onStartEdit`, `onCancelEdit`, `onSubmitEdit`: Functions for starting, cancelling, and submitting the edit of a message.

## Usage

This component is likely used in a chat UI where it renders a list of chat messages. When a message is clicked for editing, the `setEditingMessage` function is called with the message as an argument, which sets the `editingMessage` state. The `onCancelEdit` prop resets the `editingMessage` state, and the `onSubmitEdit` prop calls the `handleSendEdit` function from the `useChatHandler` hook.
