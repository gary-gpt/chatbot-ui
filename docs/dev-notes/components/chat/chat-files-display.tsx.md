# ChatFilesDisplay.tsx

This file is a part of a chatbot UI and is responsible for displaying chat files and images. It provides the ability to view, hide, and retrieve files associated with chat messages. It also allows users to preview files and images, and to delete them from the chat.

## Exports

The file exports a single component, `ChatFilesDisplay`, which is a functional component in React.

### `ChatFilesDisplay`

This is the main component exported by the file. It uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to access and manipulate the state of the chat files and images. It also uses the `useHotkey` hook to toggle the display of the files and the file retrieval setting with the "f" and "e" keys respectively.

The component maintains its own state for the selected file and image, and whether to show the file preview. It combines new message files and images with existing chat files and images, filters out duplicates, and displays them in a list. Each file or image can be clicked to open a preview, and an "x" icon is provided to remove the file or image from the chat.

The `ChatFilesDisplay` component also includes a button to toggle the display of the files, and a `ChatRetrievalSettings` component to adjust the file retrieval settings.

### `RetrievalToggle`

This is a helper component used within `ChatFilesDisplay`. It displays an indicator of whether file retrieval is enabled, and provides a tooltip with an explanation. The indicator can be clicked to toggle the file retrieval setting.

## Types

The file uses several types imported from other modules:

- `ChatbotUIContext`: The context object for the chatbot UI, which provides access to the state and actions related to the chat files and images.
- `ChatFile`: The type for chat files.
- `MessageImage`: The type for images in chat messages.

## Usage

This component is likely used within a larger chatbot UI. It would be included wherever a list of chat files and images needs to be displayed, with the ability to preview and delete them, and adjust the file retrieval settings.

## Structure and Nuance

The file makes extensive use of the React Context API to manage state, and the `useHotkey` hook to add keyboard shortcuts. It also uses the `useState` hook to maintain its own state, and the `useContext` hook to access the `ChatbotUIContext`.

The component uses conditional rendering to display different elements based on the state. For example, it only displays the file preview if `showPreview` is true and a file or image is selected. It also conditionally renders the list of files and images based on whether `showFilesDisplay` is true and there are files or images to display.

The file uses the `async/await` syntax to handle promises, specifically when getting a link to a file from storage and opening it in a new tab. It also uses the spread operator and the `filter` method to combine and filter arrays of files and images.
