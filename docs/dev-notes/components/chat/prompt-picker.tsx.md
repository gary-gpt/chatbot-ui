# PromptPicker.tsx

This file is a React component named `PromptPicker`. It is used to select and manage prompts in a chatbot UI context. The component allows users to filter prompts based on a slash command, select a prompt, and handle prompt variables.

## Exports

The file exports a single component, `PromptPicker`.

## Functions

The `PromptPicker` component uses several functions to manage its state and behavior:

- `handleSelectPrompt`: This function is imported from `usePromptAndCommand` hook. It's used to handle the selection of a prompt.
- `handleOpenChange`: This function is used to control the visibility of the prompt picker.
- `callSelectPrompt`: This function is used to handle the selection of a prompt. It checks if the selected prompt has any variables. If it does, it prepares these variables for input. If not, it selects the prompt and closes the picker.
- `getKeyDownHandler`: This function returns a function that handles keydown events. It's used to navigate through the list of prompts and select a prompt using the keyboard.
- `handleSubmitPromptVariables`: This function is used to submit the values of the prompt variables. It replaces the variable placeholders in the prompt content with the entered values, selects the prompt, and closes the picker.
- `handleCancelPromptVariables`: This function is used to cancel the input of prompt variables. It closes the variable input dialog and clears the variable values.
- `handleKeydownPromptVariables`: This function handles keydown events in the variable input dialog. It submits the variable values when the Enter key is pressed.

## State

The component uses several state variables:

- `promptVariables`: An array of objects representing the variables of the currently selected prompt.
- `showPromptVariables`: A boolean indicating whether the variable input dialog is open.
- `isTyping`: A boolean indicating whether the user is currently typing in a textarea.
- `isPromptPickerOpen`: A boolean indicating whether the prompt picker is open.

## Context

The component uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to access the current prompts, the state of the prompt picker, the currently focused prompt, and the current slash command.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The component uses the `useRef` hook to keep a reference to each prompt item. This allows it to focus the first prompt when the prompt picker is opened and to navigate through the prompts using the keyboard.

The component uses the `useEffect` hook to focus the first prompt whenever the focused prompt changes.

The component uses a regular expression to find variable placeholders in the prompt content. These placeholders are then replaced with the entered variable values when the prompt is selected.
