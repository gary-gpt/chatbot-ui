# useChatHistoryHandler.ts

This TypeScript file defines a custom hook for handling chat history in a chat component. It provides functions to set the new message content to the previous or next user message in the chat history.

## Exports

The file exports a single function `useChatHistoryHandler`.

### useChatHistoryHandler

This is a custom hook that provides functions to manipulate the chat history in a chat component. It returns an object containing two functions:

- `setNewMessageContentToPreviousUserMessage`: Sets the new message content to the previous user message.
- `setNewMessageContentToNextUserMessage`: Sets the new message content to the next user message in the chat history.

## Usage

This hook is meant to be used within a React component that needs to handle chat history. It uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to get and set the user input and chat messages.

## Structure and Nuances

The hook maintains a state `messageHistoryIndex` to keep track of the current position in the chat history. This index is updated whenever a new message is set to the previous or next user message.

The hook also uses a `useEffect` to ensure that the `messageHistoryIndex` is always within the bounds of the chat messages array. This is important because the chat messages could be deleted, which could potentially cause the `messageHistoryIndex` to point to a non-existent message.

The `setNewMessageContentToPreviousUserMessage` and `setNewMessageContentToNextUserMessage` functions use a while loop to find the previous or next user message in the chat history. They update the user input and `messageHistoryIndex` accordingly. If there is no next user message, `setNewMessageContentToNextUserMessage` resets the user input and sets the `messageHistoryIndex` to the end of the chat history.

## Interesting Nuances

The hook uses the `isGenerating` flag from the `ChatbotUIContext` to prevent updating the `messageHistoryIndex` while new messages are being generated. This ensures that the `messageHistoryIndex` is not updated prematurely, which could potentially cause it to point to a non-existent message.
