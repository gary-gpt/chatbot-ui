# useScroll.ts

The `useScroll.ts` file is a custom React hook that manages the scroll behavior of a chat interface. It provides functionality for automatically scrolling to the top or bottom of the chat, and tracks whether the user has manually scrolled, whether the chat is at the top or bottom, and whether the chat content is overflowing the chat container.

## Exports

The file exports a single function, `useScroll`.

### useScroll

`useScroll` is a custom React hook that provides scroll-related functionality and state for a chat interface. It does not take any arguments.

The hook returns an object with the following properties:

- `messagesStartRef`: A React ref object that should be attached to the first message in the chat. This is used to scroll to the top of the chat.

- `messagesEndRef`: A React ref object that should be attached to the last message in the chat. This is used to scroll to the bottom of the chat.

- `isAtTop`: A boolean state value indicating whether the chat is currently scrolled to the top.

- `isAtBottom`: A boolean state value indicating whether the chat is currently scrolled to the bottom.

- `userScrolled`: A boolean state value indicating whether the user has manually scrolled the chat.

- `isOverflowing`: A boolean state value indicating whether the chat content is overflowing the chat container.

- `handleScroll`: A function that should be used as the onScroll event handler for the chat container. It updates the `isAtTop`, `isAtBottom`, `userScrolled`, and `isOverflowing` state values based on the current scroll position.

- `scrollToTop`: A function that scrolls the chat to the top.

- `scrollToBottom`: A function that scrolls the chat to the bottom.

- `setIsAtBottom`: A function to manually set the `isAtBottom` state.

## Usage

To use this hook, import it and call it in a functional component:

```tsx
import { useScroll } from './useScroll'

function Chat() {
  const {
    messagesStartRef,
    messagesEndRef,
    isAtTop,
    isAtBottom,
    userScrolled,
    isOverflowing,
    handleScroll,
    scrollToTop,
    scrollToBottom,
    setIsAtBottom
  } = useScroll()

  // ...
}
```

Attach the `messagesStartRef` and `messagesEndRef` to the first and last messages in the chat, respectively. Use `handleScroll` as the onScroll event handler for the chat container. Use the `scrollToTop` and `scrollToBottom` functions to programmatically scroll the chat. Use the `isAtTop`, `isAtBottom`, `userScrolled`, and `isOverflowing` state values as needed in your component.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The hook uses the `useContext` hook to access the `ChatbotUIContext`, which provides the `isGenerating` and `chatMessages` values. These are used to determine when to automatically scroll to the bottom of the chat: when new messages are added (`chatMessages` changes) and the chatbot is not currently generating a message (`isGenerating` is false).

The hook also uses the `useRef` hook to create a mutable ref object, `isAutoScrolling`, which is used to prevent the `userScrolled` state from being set to true when the chat is automatically scrolled to the bottom.
