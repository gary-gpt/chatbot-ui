# File: useSelectFileHandler.ts

This TypeScript file is part of a larger project that involves a chatbot UI. It provides a custom React hook, `useSelectFileHandler`, which is used to handle file selection and processing in the chatbot UI.

## Exports

The file exports two items:

1. `ACCEPTED_FILE_TYPES`: An array of MIME types that the chatbot UI accepts for file uploads. These types are joined into a single string with commas separating each type.

2. `useSelectFileHandler`: A custom React hook that provides functionality for handling file selection and processing.

## useSelectFileHandler Hook

The `useSelectFileHandler` hook is used to handle file selection and processing. It uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to access various state and setter functions related to the chatbot UI. It also maintains its own state, `filesToAccept`, which is a string of accepted file types.

The hook returns an object with two properties:

- `handleSelectDeviceFile`: A function that handles file selection from the device. It processes the selected file based on its type, and updates the chatbot UI context accordingly.
- `filesToAccept`: A string of accepted file types.

### handleSelectDeviceFile Function

The `handleSelectDeviceFile` function is an asynchronous function that takes a `File` object as its argument. It processes the selected file based on its type, and updates the chatbot UI context accordingly.

The function first checks if the necessary context values are available. If not, it returns immediately. It then sets the `showFilesDisplay` and `useRetrieval` context values to `true`.

Next, it checks the type of the file. If the file is an image, it reads the file as a data URL. If the file is of a type included in `ACCEPTED_FILE_TYPES`, it simplifies the file type and updates the `newMessageFiles` context value with a loading file object.

If the file is a `.docx` file, it extracts the raw text from the file, creates a new file in the database, and updates the `files` and `newMessageFiles` context values with the created file.

If the file is not a `.docx` file, it reads the file as an array buffer if it's a PDF, or as text if it's of any other accepted type.

If the file type is not supported, it throws an error.

Once the file has been read, the function creates a new file in the database and updates the `files` and `newMessageFiles` context values with the created file. If an error occurs during this process, it displays an error message and removes the loading file object from the `newMessageFiles` context value.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `useSelectFileHandler` hook uses the `useContext` hook to access the `ChatbotUIContext`, which provides various state and setter functions related to the chatbot UI. It also uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to maintain and update its own state.

The `handleSelectDeviceFile` function uses the `FileReader` API to read the selected file, and the `mammoth` library to extract raw text from `.docx` files. It also uses the `createFile` and `createDocXFile` functions to create new files in the database.

The `handleSelectDeviceFile` function handles various file types differently, and updates the chatbot UI context accordingly. It also handles errors gracefully, displaying an error message and cleaning up any temporary or loading file objects if an error occurs.
