## Structure and Nuance

The file is structured as a collection of helper functions. Each function is exported individually, allowing them to be imported and used separately in other files. The functions use a combination of async/await and promises for handling asynchronous operations. They also use React's useState hook for managing state. The functions throw errors when necessary to handle invalid operations or unexpected conditions.
