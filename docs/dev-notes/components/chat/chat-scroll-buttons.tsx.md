# ChatScrollButtons.tsx

This TypeScript file defines and exports a functional component `ChatScrollButtons` for a chat application. The component is used to render scroll buttons that allow users to scroll to the top or bottom of the chat.

## Exports

The file exports a single functional component `ChatScrollButtons`.

## Types

The file defines a TypeScript interface `ChatScrollButtonsProps` which describes the properties that the `ChatScrollButtons` component expects:

- `isAtTop`: A boolean indicating whether the chat is currently scrolled to the top.
- `isAtBottom`: A boolean indicating whether the chat is currently scrolled to the bottom.
- `isOverflowing`: A boolean indicating whether the chat content is overflowing the chat container.
- `scrollToTop`: A function to be called when the user wants to scroll to the top of the chat.
- `scrollToBottom`: A function to be called when the user wants to scroll to the bottom of the chat.

## Usage

The `ChatScrollButtons` component is used in the context of a chat application. It should be placed in a location where the user can easily access it to scroll the chat. The component uses the `isAtTop`, `isAtBottom`, and `isOverflowing` properties to determine whether to render the scroll buttons. The `scrollToTop` and `scrollToBottom` properties are used as event handlers for when the user clicks on the scroll buttons.

## Structure and Nuance

The component uses the `IconCircleArrowUpFilled` and `IconCircleArrowDownFilled` icons from the `@tabler/icons-react` package to represent the scroll buttons. These icons are only rendered if the chat is overflowing and not already at the top or bottom, respectively.

The icons are given a CSS class that changes their opacity on hover, indicating to the user that they are interactive. When clicked, they call the `scrollToTop` or `scrollToBottom` function, respectively.
