# ChatSecondaryButtons.tsx

This file is a part of a chatbot UI in a TypeScript project. It defines and exports a functional component `ChatSecondaryButtons` that displays additional information about the currently selected chat and provides a button to start a new chat.

## Exports

### `ChatSecondaryButtons`

This is a functional component that takes no props. It uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to access the currently selected chat and the `useChatHandler` hook to handle the creation of a new chat.

The component returns a fragment that conditionally renders two `WithTooltip` components if a chat is currently selected. The first tooltip displays information about the selected chat, such as the model, prompt, temperature, context length, profile context, workspace instructions, and embeddings provider. The second tooltip displays a message "Start a new chat" and a button that triggers the `handleNewChat` function when clicked.

## Usage

This component is likely used in a larger chat UI, where it provides additional controls and information related to the chat. It would be used in conjunction with other components to form a complete chat interface.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The component uses the `useContext` hook to access the `ChatbotUIContext`, which presumably provides information about the current state of the chat UI. This is a common pattern in React for sharing state across multiple components.

The `WithTooltip` component is used to create tooltips that display when the user hovers over certain elements. This component takes a `delayDuration`, `display`, and `trigger` prop. The `display` prop is what is shown in the tooltip, and the `trigger` prop is the element that triggers the tooltip to appear when hovered over.

The `handleNewChat` function is obtained from the `useChatHandler` hook and is used to start a new chat when the corresponding button is clicked. This is an example of encapsulating behavior in custom hooks, which is a common pattern in React.
