# DeleteWorkspace.tsx

This file is a React component that provides a user interface for deleting a workspace in a chatbot application. It uses a dialog box to confirm the deletion of a workspace and handles the deletion process.

## Exports

This file exports a single component, `DeleteWorkspace`.

### DeleteWorkspace

`DeleteWorkspace` is a functional component that takes in `DeleteWorkspaceProps` as props. 

#### Props

`DeleteWorkspaceProps` is an interface that requires two properties:

- `workspace`: This is an object that represents the workspace to be deleted. It must match the structure of a workspace in the `workspaces` table.
- `onDelete`: This is a function that will be called after the workspace is successfully deleted.

#### Functionality

When rendered, `DeleteWorkspace` displays a button that, when clicked, opens a dialog box. The dialog box warns the user that deleting a workspace will delete all of its data and requires the user to type the name of the workspace to confirm the deletion.

The component uses the `ChatbotUIContext` to manage the application's state. When the workspace is deleted, it updates the list of workspaces, sets the selected workspace to the first workspace in the updated list, and navigates to the chat page of the new selected workspace.

The component also uses the `useChatHandler` hook to handle a new chat after the workspace is deleted.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `DeleteWorkspace` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the dialog box and the input field. It also uses the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the delete button, which allows it to programmatically click the button when the enter key is pressed.

The component uses the `deleteWorkspace` function from the `workspaces` database module to delete the workspace from the database.

The component uses the `useRouter` hook from Next.js to navigate to the chat page of the new selected workspace after the current workspace is deleted.
