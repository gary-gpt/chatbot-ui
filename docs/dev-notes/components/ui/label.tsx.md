# Label.tsx

This file is a TypeScript module that exports a custom `Label` component. This component is a wrapper around the `LabelPrimitive.Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-label` library. The purpose of this wrapper is to apply some custom styles and behaviors to the base label component.

## Imports

The module imports several libraries and utilities:

- `LabelPrimitive` from `@radix-ui/react-label`: This is the base label component that the custom `Label` component wraps.
- `cva` and `VariantProps` from `class-variance-authority`: These are utilities for managing CSS class variants.
- `React` from `react`: The JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- `cn` from `@/lib/utils`: A utility function for concatenating class names.

## labelVariants

The `labelVariants` constant is a function created by the `cva` utility. It's used to generate a string of CSS class names that apply the custom styles for the `Label` component. The string includes classes for font size, font weight, line height, and some styles for when the label is disabled.

## Label Component

The `Label` component is a function component that uses the `React.forwardRef` function to pass a `ref` to the underlying `LabelPrimitive.Root` component. This allows the parent component to directly interact with the DOM element if necessary.

The `Label` component accepts all the props of `LabelPrimitive.Root` as well as the variant props of `labelVariants`. The `className` prop is combined with the class names from `labelVariants` to apply the custom styles.

The `displayName` of the `Label` component is set to the `displayName` of `LabelPrimitive.Root`. This helps with debugging and testing by making the component easier to find in the React DevTools and test snapshots.

## Exports

The module exports the `Label` component. This allows other modules to import and use the custom `Label` component.

## Usage

To use the `Label` component, import it from this module and use it like any other React component. Pass any props that `LabelPrimitive.Root` accepts, and they will be passed through to the underlying component. The custom styles from `labelVariants` will be applied automatically.
