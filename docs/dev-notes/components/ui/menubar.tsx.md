# Menubar.tsx

This file is a TypeScript module that exports a set of components for creating a menu bar in a React application. It uses the `@radix-ui/react-menubar` library to provide the base functionality and structure of the menu bar, and then extends and customizes these components to fit the specific needs of the application.

## Exports

The file exports the following components:

- `Menubar`: The root component of the menu bar. It applies some default styles and forwards all other props to the underlying `MenubarPrimitive.Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-menubar` library.
- `MenubarMenu`: A component that represents a menu in the menu bar. It is a direct re-export of the `Menu` component from the `@radix-ui/react-menubar` library.
- `MenubarTrigger`: A component that triggers the opening of a menu when clicked. It applies some default styles and forwards all other props to the underlying `MenubarPrimitive.Trigger` component.
- `MenubarContent`: A component that contains the content of a menu. It applies some default styles and forwards all other props to the underlying `MenubarPrimitive.Content` component.
- `MenubarItem`: A component that represents an item in a menu. It applies some default styles and forwards all other props to the underlying `MenubarPrimitive.Item` component.
- `MenubarSeparator`: A component that represents a separator between items in a menu. It applies some default styles and forwards all other props to the underlying `MenubarPrimitive.Separator` component.
- `MenubarLabel`: A component that represents a label for a group of items in a menu. It applies some default styles and forwards all other props to the underlying `MenubarPrimitive.Label` component.
- `MenubarCheckboxItem`: A component that represents a checkbox item in a menu. It applies some default styles and forwards all other props to the underlying `MenubarPrimitive.CheckboxItem` component.
- `MenubarRadioGroup`: A component that represents a group of radio items in a menu. It is a direct re-export of the `RadioGroup` component from the `@radix-ui/react-menubar` library.
- `MenubarRadioItem`: A component that represents a radio item in a menu. It applies some default styles and forwards all other props to the underlying `MenubarPrimitive.RadioItem` component.
- `MenubarPortal`: A component that represents a portal in which a menu can be rendered. It is a direct re-export of the `Portal` component from the `@radix-ui/react-menubar` library.
- `MenubarSubContent`: A component that contains the content of a submenu. It applies some default styles and forwards all other props to the underlying `MenubarPrimitive.SubContent` component.
- `MenubarSubTrigger`: A component that triggers the opening of a submenu when clicked. It applies some default styles and forwards all other props to the underlying `MenubarPrimitive.SubTrigger` component.
- `MenubarGroup`: A component that represents a group of items in a menu. It is a direct re-export of the `Group` component from the `@radix-ui/react-menubar` library.
- `MenubarSub`: A component that represents a submenu in a menu. It is a direct re-export of the `Sub` component from the `@radix-ui/react-menubar` library.
- `MenubarShortcut`: A component that represents a keyboard shortcut for a menu item. It applies some default styles and forwards all other props to an underlying `span` element.

## Usage

These components can be used to create a menu bar in a React application. The `Menubar` component should be used as the root of the menu bar, and the other components can be used to add menus, items, separators, labels, and shortcuts to the menu bar.

## Structure and Nuance

Each component in this file is a function component that uses the `React.forwardRef` function to forward a ref to the underlying component from the `@radix-ui/react-menubar` library or to an underlying `span` element in the case of the `MenubarShortcut` component.

The components apply some default styles using the `cn` function, which is imported from the `@/lib/utils` module. This function is used to concatenate class names.

The components also forward all other props to the underlying components or elements, which allows for further customization when using these components.

The `displayName` property is set on each component to the `displayName` of the underlying component from the `@radix-ui/react-menubar` library or to a string in the case of the `MenubarShortcut` component. This helps with debugging and testing.
