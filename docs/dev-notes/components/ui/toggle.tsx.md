# Toggle.tsx

This file defines a `Toggle` component for a React application. The component is built using the `TogglePrimitive` from the `@radix-ui/react-toggle` library. The file also defines a set of variants for the `Toggle` component using the `class-variance-authority` (cva) library.

## Exports

The file exports the `Toggle` component and the `toggleVariants` object.

### `Toggle`

`Toggle` is a React component that renders a toggle button. The component uses the `TogglePrimitive.Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-toggle` library as its base. The component is forwarded with `React.forwardRef`, allowing the parent component to access the ref of the `TogglePrimitive.Root` component.

The `Toggle` component accepts all the props of the `TogglePrimitive.Root` component, as well as the variant props defined in `toggleVariants`.

### `toggleVariants`

`toggleVariants` is an object that defines a set of variants for the `Toggle` component. It is created using the `cva` function from the `class-variance-authority` library. The variants include different styles for the `variant` and `size` props.

The `variant` prop can be either `default` or `outline`, and the `size` prop can be `default`, `sm`, or `lg`. The `defaultVariants` object specifies that the default values for `variant` and `size` are both `default`.

## Usage

To use the `Toggle` component, import it from the file and use it in your JSX:

```jsx
import { Toggle } from './Toggle.tsx';

function MyComponent() {
  return <Toggle variant="outline" size="lg" />;
}
```

You can pass all the props you would normally pass to the `TogglePrimitive.Root` component, as well as the `variant` and `size` props.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `Toggle` component uses the `cn` function from the `@/lib/utils` module to combine the class names generated by `toggleVariants` and any additional class names passed in the `className` prop.

The `toggleVariants` object uses a template literal to define a long string of class names. This string includes several CSS properties and values, as well as data attributes and pseudo-class selectors. This is a powerful way to define complex styles in a single string.
