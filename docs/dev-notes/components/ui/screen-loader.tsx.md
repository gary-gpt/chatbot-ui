# ScreenLoader.tsx

This file defines and exports a React functional component, `ScreenLoader`, which is used to display a loading screen. The loading screen is represented by a spinning icon from the `@tabler/icons-react` library.

## Imports

- `IconLoader2` from `@tabler/icons-react`: This is a specific icon from the `@tabler/icons-react` library that is used to represent the loading state.
- `FC` from `react`: `FC` stands for Functional Component. It's a type from the `react` library that is used to type the `ScreenLoader` component.

## Interface

- `ScreenLoaderProps`: This is an empty interface that is used to type the props for the `ScreenLoader` component. Currently, this component does not accept any props.

## Component

- `ScreenLoader`: This is a functional component that returns a div element with a spinning `IconLoader2` icon. The div is styled with several CSS classes to center the icon and give it a spinning animation.

## Usage

The `ScreenLoader` component can be used in any part of the application where a loading state needs to be represented. Since it does not accept any props, it can be used directly without any configuration. Here is an example of how it can be used:

```jsx
import { ScreenLoader } from './ScreenLoader';

function App() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? <ScreenLoader /> : <div>Content</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `ScreenLoader` component is displayed when the `isLoading` state is `true`. When `isLoading` is `false`, the content is displayed instead.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `ScreenLoader` component uses the `IconLoader2` icon from the `@tabler/icons-react` library. This icon is given a spinning animation with the `animate-spin` CSS class. This creates a simple and effective loading screen with minimal code.
