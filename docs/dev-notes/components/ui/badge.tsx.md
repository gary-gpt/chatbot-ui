# Badge.tsx

This file is a TypeScript (TSX) module that exports a `Badge` component and a `badgeVariants` object. The `Badge` component is a React component that renders a styled div element. The `badgeVariants` object is used to define different styles for the `Badge` component.

## Exports

### `Badge`

`Badge` is a React functional component that accepts an object of `BadgeProps` as its props. The `BadgeProps` interface extends the `React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>` and `VariantProps<typeof badgeVariants>` interfaces, meaning it can accept any standard HTML div attributes as well as the variant prop.

The `Badge` component uses the `badgeVariants` function to generate a class name string based on the `variant` prop. This class name string is then combined with any additional class names passed in through the `className` prop. The resulting class name string and any remaining props are passed to the rendered div element.

### `badgeVariants`

`badgeVariants` is an object created by the `cva` (class variance authority) function. It defines four different variants: `default`, `secondary`, `destructive`, and `outline`. Each variant corresponds to a different set of CSS classes that style the `Badge` component.

## Usage

To use the `Badge` component, import it and the `badgeVariants` object from the module. Pass in the desired variant as a prop to the `Badge` component. The `Badge` component will then render a div element with the appropriate styling.

```jsx
import { Badge, badgeVariants } from './Badge.tsx';

function App() {
  return (
    <Badge variant={badgeVariants.variants.variant.default}>
      Default Badge
    </Badge>
  );
}
```

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `cva` function is used to create a set of variant styles for the `Badge` component. This allows for a flexible and reusable way to style the component based on the `variant` prop. The `cn` function is used to combine class names, which allows for additional styling to be added to the `Badge` component.
