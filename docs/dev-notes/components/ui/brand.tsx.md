# Brand.tsx

This TypeScript file defines and exports a functional component `Brand` for a React application. The component is used to display a link to the website 'https://www.chatbotui.com' with an SVG icon and the text 'Chatbot UI'. The SVG icon and the text are stacked vertically, and the entire component is designed to be clickable. On hover, the opacity of the component is reduced to 50%.

## Exports

### `Brand`

This is a functional component that takes an optional `theme` prop. The `theme` prop can be either 'dark' or 'light', and defaults to 'dark' if not provided.

The `Brand` component uses the `Link` component from the 'next/link' library to create a link to 'https://www.chatbotui.com'. The link opens in a new tab and has the `rel` attribute set to 'noopener noreferrer' for security reasons.

Inside the link, there's a `div` that contains the `ChatbotUISVG` component. The `ChatbotUISVG` component is passed the `theme` prop and a `scale` prop set to 0.3. Below this `div`, there's another `div` that contains the text 'Chatbot UI'. This text is styled with a font size of '4xl', a bold font weight, and wide letter spacing.

## Types

### `BrandProps`

This is an interface that defines the props for the `Brand` component. It has one optional property `theme` which can be either 'dark' or 'light'.

## Usage

The `Brand` component can be used in a React application like this:

```jsx
<Brand theme="light" />
```

or simply as:

```jsx
<Brand />
```

In the first example, the `Brand` component is rendered with a 'light' theme. In the second example, since no `theme` prop is provided, the `Brand` component defaults to a 'dark' theme.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `Brand` component uses the ternary operator to determine the theme for the `ChatbotUISVG` component. If the `theme` prop is 'dark', it passes 'dark' to the `ChatbotUISVG` component. Otherwise, it passes 'light'. This ensures that the `ChatbotUISVG` component always receives a valid theme.
