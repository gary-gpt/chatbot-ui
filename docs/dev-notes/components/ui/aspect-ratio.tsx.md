# File: AspectRatio.js

This JavaScript file is a simple wrapper for the `@radix-ui/react-aspect-ratio` library. It imports the library, extracts the `Root` component, and exports it under the name `AspectRatio`.

## Exports

This file exports a single component, `AspectRatio`.

### `AspectRatio`

This is a component that is used to maintain a specific aspect ratio for its child elements. It is a wrapper around the `Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-aspect-ratio` library.

## Usage

The `AspectRatio` component can be used in the same way as the `Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-aspect-ratio` library. It can be imported from this file and used to wrap other components or elements to maintain a specific aspect ratio.

```javascript
import { AspectRatio } from './AspectRatio.js';

// Usage in a React component
<AspectRatio>
  <YourComponent />
</AspectRatio>
```

## Structure and Nuance

The file uses the `use client` directive at the top, which is a Prisma directive that specifies the client to use for the following code. However, this directive doesn't seem to have any effect in this file, as no Prisma client is used.

The file is a simple wrapper around the `Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-aspect-ratio` library. This could be useful if you want to provide a more descriptive name for the component, or if you want to add additional functionality or styling in the future.
