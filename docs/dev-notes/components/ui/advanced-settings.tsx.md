# AdvancedSettings.tsx

This TypeScript file defines and exports a functional component `AdvancedSettings` for use in a React application. The component is designed to provide a collapsible section in the user interface, specifically for advanced settings.

## Imports

The file imports several components and hooks:

- `Collapsible`, `CollapsibleContent`, `CollapsibleTrigger` from a local UI library. These are used to create the collapsible section.
- `IconChevronDown`, `IconChevronRight` from `@tabler/icons-react` for displaying the open/close state of the collapsible section.
- `FC` (Functional Component) and `useState` from `react` for defining the component and managing its state.

## Interface

The `AdvancedSettingsProps` interface is defined to type check the props of the `AdvancedSettings` component. It expects one prop: `children`, which should be a `ReactNode`. This allows any valid React child (or children) to be passed into the `AdvancedSettings` component.

## Component

The `AdvancedSettings` component is a functional component that uses the `useState` hook to manage its open/close state. It initially sets the state to `false`, meaning the collapsible section is closed by default.

The `handleOpenChange` function is used to update the `isOpen` state whenever the collapsible section's state changes.

The component returns a `Collapsible` component with a `CollapsibleTrigger` and `CollapsibleContent`. The `CollapsibleTrigger` displays the text "Advanced Settings" and an icon indicating whether the section is open or closed. The `CollapsibleContent` displays the `children` passed into the `AdvancedSettings` component.

## Usage

The `AdvancedSettings` component can be used in a React application like so:

```jsx
<AdvancedSettings>
  <p>These are some advanced settings.</p>
</AdvancedSettings>
```

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `isOpen` state and `handleOpenChange` function are commented out lines of code that suggest the open/close state of the `AdvancedSettings` component could be stored in `localStorage`. This would allow the component to remember its state across different user sessions. However, this functionality is currently not implemented.
