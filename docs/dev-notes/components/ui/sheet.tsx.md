# Source File Documentation: Sheet.js

This source file, `Sheet.js`, is a component library for a dialog box or a modal window, built using the Radix UI React Dialog library. It provides a set of pre-styled components that can be used to create a dialog box with various parts like header, footer, title, description, content, overlay, and close button.

## Exports

The file exports the following components:

- `Sheet`: The root component of the dialog box.
- `SheetClose`: A component for the close button of the dialog box.
- `SheetContent`: A component for the content of the dialog box.
- `SheetDescription`: A component for the description of the dialog box.
- `SheetFooter`: A component for the footer of the dialog box.
- `SheetHeader`: A component for the header of the dialog box.
- `SheetOverlay`: A component for the overlay of the dialog box.
- `SheetPortal`: A component for the portal of the dialog box.
- `SheetTitle`: A component for the title of the dialog box.
- `SheetTrigger`: A component for the trigger of the dialog box.

## Types

The file defines the following types:

- `SheetContentProps`: This type extends the properties of the `SheetPrimitive.Content` component and the variant properties of the `sheetVariants`.

## Functions

The file uses the following functions:

- `React.forwardRef`: This function is used to create a ref for the components. It is used in `SheetOverlay`, `SheetContent`, `SheetTitle`, and `SheetDescription` components.
- `cn`: This function is used to concatenate class names.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The file uses the `class-variance-authority` (cva) library to define the `sheetVariants` which are used to style the `SheetContent` component based on the `side` variant. The `side` variant can be `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right`.

The `SheetContent` component also includes commented code for a close button, which can be uncommented and used if needed.

The `SheetHeader` and `SheetFooter` components use the `flex` CSS property to arrange their children. The `SheetFooter` component reverses the order of its children on small screens and aligns them to the end on larger screens.

The `SheetTitle` and `SheetDescription` components use the `text-foreground`, `text-lg`, `font-semibold`, `text-muted-foreground`, and `text-sm` classes to style the text.
