# Table.tsx

This file defines and exports a set of React components that are used to create a table. The components are designed to be used together to form a complete table structure, including the table itself, headers, body, footer, rows, cells, and caption.

## Exports

The file exports the following components:

- `Table`: This is the main table component. It creates a `div` with a `table` element inside it. The `table` element is given a set of default CSS classes and any additional classes passed in via the `className` prop.

- `TableHeader`: This component creates a `thead` element, which is used to group the header content in a table. It also accepts additional CSS classes via the `className` prop.

- `TableBody`: This component creates a `tbody` element, which is used to group the body content in a table. It also accepts additional CSS classes via the `className` prop.

- `TableFooter`: This component creates a `tfoot` element, which is used to group the footer content in a table. It also accepts additional CSS classes via the `className` prop.

- `TableRow`: This component creates a `tr` element, which is used to group cells into a table row. It also accepts additional CSS classes via the `className` prop.

- `TableHead`: This component creates a `th` element, which defines a cell as header of a group of cells. It also accepts additional CSS classes via the `className` prop.

- `TableCell`: This component creates a `td` element, which defines a cell of a table that contains data. It also accepts additional CSS classes via the `className` prop.

- `TableCaption`: This component creates a `caption` element, which provides a title for the table. It also accepts additional CSS classes via the `className` prop.

## Usage

Each of these components is a React functional component that uses the `forwardRef` function to forward refs. They each accept `props` and `ref` as parameters, and return a JSX element. The `props` parameter is destructured to separate out the `className` prop, which is used to add additional CSS classes to the element.

The `cn` function from "@/lib/utils" is used to combine the default CSS classes with any additional classes passed in via the `className` prop.

## Structure and Nuance

Each component has a `displayName` property set, which is a string that helps identify the component in React DevTools.

The CSS classes used in these components suggest that they are part of a larger design system, with classes like "text-muted-foreground", "bg-muted/50", and "font-medium". The use of the `cn` function to combine classes also suggests that the system supports complex class combinations.
