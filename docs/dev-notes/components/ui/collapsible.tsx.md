# Collapsible.js

This file is a JavaScript module that imports and exports components from the `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` package. This package provides primitive components for creating collapsible sections in a React application. The file is used in the client-side context, as indicated by the `"use client"` directive at the top of the file.

## Exports

The file exports three components:

- `Collapsible`: This is the root component for creating a collapsible section. It provides the context and state for its child components.

- `CollapsibleTrigger`: This component is used to trigger the opening and closing of the collapsible section. It should be a child of the `Collapsible` component.

- `CollapsibleContent`: This component contains the content that is shown or hidden when the `CollapsibleTrigger` is clicked. It should also be a child of the `Collapsible` component.

## Usage

While the file itself does not contain usage examples, the exported components are typically used in a React application like so:

```jsx
import { Collapsible, CollapsibleTrigger, CollapsibleContent } from './Collapsible';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Collapsible>
      <CollapsibleTrigger>
        Click me to show/hide content
      </CollapsibleTrigger>
      <CollapsibleContent>
        This is the content that will be shown or hidden.
      </CollapsibleContent>
    </Collapsible>
  );
}
```

In this example, clicking on the text "Click me to show/hide content" will show or hide the text "This is the content that will be shown or hidden."

## Structure and Nuance

The file is structured in a straightforward manner, with imports at the top, followed by the definition of constants that reference the imported components, and finally the export of these constants.

One nuance of this file is that it abstracts away the details of the `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` package. This means that other files in the project can import the `Collapsible`, `CollapsibleTrigger`, and `CollapsibleContent` components from this file, without needing to know about the `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` package. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain, especially in a large project.
