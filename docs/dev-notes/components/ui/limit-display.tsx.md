# LimitDisplay.tsx

This TypeScript file defines and exports a functional React component named `LimitDisplay`. This component is used to display the usage of a certain limit in a small, italicized text.

## Interface: LimitDisplayProps

The `LimitDisplayProps` interface is used to type check the props of the `LimitDisplay` component. It consists of two properties:

- `used`: A number representing the amount currently used.
- `limit`: A number representing the total limit.

## Component: LimitDisplay

The `LimitDisplay` component is a functional component (FC) that takes in `LimitDisplayProps` as its props. It destructures `used` and `limit` from the props and displays them in a `div` element. The text is styled with the classes `text-xs` and `italic`, which suggests that the text will be small and italicized.

The component returns a JSX expression that displays the `used` and `limit` values separated by a slash (/). This suggests that the component is used to display some sort of usage or limit, such as memory or storage usage.

### Usage

The `LimitDisplay` component is used by importing it from its file and including it in JSX like any other React component. The `used` and `limit` props must be provided when using this component. Here is an example:

```jsx
import { LimitDisplay } from './LimitDisplay'

// ...

<LimitDisplay used={50} limit={100} />
```

In this example, the `LimitDisplay` component will display "50/100".
