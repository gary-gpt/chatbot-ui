# SubmitButton.tsx

This TypeScript file defines and exports a `SubmitButton` component for use in a React application. The `SubmitButton` is a specialized version of a generic `Button` component, with additional functionality related to form submission status.

## Imports

The file imports the following modules:

- `React` from the "react" library, which is a fundamental dependency for defining React components.
- `useFormStatus` from the "react-dom" library, a hook that provides information about the status of a form.
- `Button` and `ButtonProps` from a local file "./button". `Button` is a component that `SubmitButton` is based on, and `ButtonProps` is a type that describes the props that `Button` accepts.

## SubmitButton

`SubmitButton` is a React component that is defined using `React.forwardRef`. This allows the component to accept a `ref` prop and pass it to the `Button` component. This can be useful in scenarios where you need to interact with the `Button`'s DOM element directly.

The component uses the `useFormStatus` hook to get the current status of the form. If the form is in a "pending" state (presumably meaning that a submission is in progress), the `Button` is disabled.

The props for `SubmitButton` are the same as for the `Button` component, as indicated by the `ButtonProps` type. Any props passed to `SubmitButton` will be forwarded to the `Button` component.

The `displayName` property is set to "SubmitButton". This is a common practice in React to make the component more identifiable in debugging tools.

## Exports

The file exports the `SubmitButton` component. This means that other files in the application can import and use `SubmitButton`.

## Usage

To use the `SubmitButton` component, you would import it from this file and use it in your JSX, like any other React component. You can pass any props that `Button` accepts. The button will automatically be disabled when the form is in a "pending" state.

```jsx
import { SubmitButton } from './SubmitButton'

// ...

<SubmitButton onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</SubmitButton>
```

In this example, `handleSubmit` would be a function in your component that handles the form submission.
