# toast.ts

This TypeScript file is a custom implementation of a toast notification system, inspired by the `react-hot-toast` library. It provides a way to add, update, dismiss, and remove toast notifications in a React application.

## Types

### `ToasterToast`

This type extends `ToastProps` (imported from "@/components/ui/toast") and adds a few more properties:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each toast.
- `title`: The title of the toast, which can be any React node.
- `description`: The description of the toast, which can also be any React node.
- `action`: An optional action element for the toast.

### `ActionType`

This type is derived from the `actionTypes` constant and represents the possible actions that can be performed on a toast.

### `Action`

This type represents the possible actions that can be dispatched to the reducer. Each action has a `type` property and may include additional properties depending on the action type.

### `State`

This interface represents the state of the toast system, which is an array of `ToasterToast` objects.

## Constants

### `TOAST_LIMIT`

This constant sets the maximum number of toasts that can be displayed at once.

### `TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY`

This constant sets the delay (in milliseconds) before a toast is automatically removed.

### `actionTypes`

This constant object defines the possible action types that can be dispatched to the reducer.

## Functions

### `genId()`

This function generates a unique ID for each toast.

### `reducer(state: State, action: Action): State`

This function is a reducer that handles the different actions that can be dispatched. It updates the state based on the action type and returns the new state.

### `dispatch(action: Action)`

This function dispatches an action to the reducer and updates the state. It also notifies all registered listeners of the state change.

### `toast({ ...props }: Toast)`

This function creates a new toast with the given properties. It returns an object with the toast's ID and functions to dismiss and update the toast.

### `useToast()`

This is a custom React hook that provides the current state of the toast system and functions to create and dismiss toasts. It also registers a listener to update the state whenever it changes.

## Exports

### `useToast`

This custom React hook is exported for use in other components.

### `toast`

This function is exported for creating new toasts.

## Usage

To use this toast system in a React component, import the `useToast` hook and call it in your component. This will provide you with the current state of the toast system and functions to create and dismiss toasts.

```jsx
import { useToast } from './toast'

function MyComponent() {
  const { toast, dismiss } = useToast()

  // Create a new toast
  const myToast = toast({ title: 'Hello, world!' })

  // Dismiss the toast
  dismiss(myToast.id)
}
```

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

This file uses a reducer pattern with a global state and dispatch function, similar to Redux or the `useReducer` hook in React. However, instead of using a context to provide the state and dispatch function to components, it uses a custom hook (`useToast`) and a global `dispatch` function. This allows the state to be shared across all components that use the `useToast` hook, without the need for a context provider.

The `toast` function creates a new toast and automatically adds it to the state. It also returns an object with the toast's ID and functions to dismiss and update the toast, providing a convenient API for managing individual toasts.

The `useToast` hook registers a listener to update its state whenever the global state changes. This ensures that the state in each component that uses the hook is always up-to-date. The listener is removed when the component unmounts, preventing memory leaks.
