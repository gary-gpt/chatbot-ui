# Slider.tsx

This file is a TypeScript module that exports a `Slider` component. This component is a customized version of the `Slider` component from the `@radix-ui/react-slider` package. The customization is done using the `React.forwardRef` function to pass a `ref` and props to the `SliderPrimitive.Root` component.

## Exports

The file exports the following:

- `Slider`: A custom `Slider` component that wraps the `SliderPrimitive.Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-slider` package.

## Types

The `Slider` component uses the following types:

- `React.ElementRef<typeof SliderPrimitive.Root>`: This is the type of the `ref` passed to the `SliderPrimitive.Root` component.
- `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof SliderPrimitive.Root>`: This is the type of the props passed to the `SliderPrimitive.Root` component.

## Usage

The `Slider` component is a custom slider component that can be used in a React application. It is used by passing a `ref` and any props that `SliderPrimitive.Root` accepts to it.

## Structure

The `Slider` component is composed of several sub-components from the `@radix-ui/react-slider` package:

- `SliderPrimitive.Root`: This is the root component of the slider. It is given a `ref`, a `className` and any other props passed to the `Slider` component.
- `SliderPrimitive.Track`: This is the track of the slider. It has a `className` of `"bg-secondary relative h-2 w-full grow overflow-hidden rounded-full"`.
- `SliderPrimitive.Range`: This is the range of the slider. It has a `className` of `"bg-primary absolute h-full"`.
- `SliderPrimitive.Thumb`: This is the thumb of the slider. It has a `className` of `"border-primary bg-background ring-offset-background focus-visible:ring-ring block size-5 cursor-grab rounded-full border-2 transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50"`.

## Nuance

The `Slider` component uses the `cn` function from the `@/lib/utils` module to concatenate class names. This function is used to concatenate the `"relative flex w-full touch-none select-none items-center"` class name with the `className` prop passed to the `Slider` component.
