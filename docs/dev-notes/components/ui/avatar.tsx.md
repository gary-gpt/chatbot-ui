# Avatar.tsx

This file is a TypeScript module that exports three React components: `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback`. These components are used to display user avatars in a web application. The components are built using the `@radix-ui/react-avatar` library.

## Exports

### Avatar

The `Avatar` component is a wrapper around the `AvatarPrimitive.Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-avatar` library. It accepts all the props of the `AvatarPrimitive.Root` component and forwards them along with a `ref` using `React.forwardRef`. The component also accepts a `className` prop which is combined with a set of predefined classes using the `cn` utility function.

### AvatarImage

The `AvatarImage` component is a wrapper around the `AvatarPrimitive.Image` component from the `@radix-ui/react-avatar` library. Similar to the `Avatar` component, it accepts all the props of the `AvatarPrimitive.Image` component and forwards them along with a `ref` using `React.forwardRef`. The component also accepts a `className` prop which is combined with a set of predefined classes using the `cn` utility function.

### AvatarFallback

The `AvatarFallback` component is a wrapper around the `AvatarPrimitive.Fallback` component from the `@radix-ui/react-avatar` library. It is used as a fallback when the avatar image is not available. The component accepts all the props of the `AvatarPrimitive.Fallback` component and forwards them along with a `ref` using `React.forwardRef`. The component also accepts a `className` prop which is combined with a set of predefined classes using the `cn` utility function.

## Usage

These components can be used in a React application to display user avatars. The `Avatar` component is used to display the avatar, the `AvatarImage` component is used to display the avatar image, and the `AvatarFallback` component is used as a fallback when the avatar image is not available.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `cn` utility function is used to combine the `className` prop with a set of predefined classes. This allows for easy customization of the components' styles.

Each component sets its `displayName` to the `displayName` of the corresponding `AvatarPrimitive` component. This is useful for debugging and testing, as the `displayName` is used in error messages and can also be used to find components in the React DevTools.
