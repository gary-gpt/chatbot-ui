# FilePreview.tsx

This file is a React component that provides a preview of a file, image, or file item in a dialog. It is part of a chat application, and it is used to display images, files, or file items that are part of chat messages.

## Exports

The file exports a single component, `FilePreview`.

### `FilePreview` Component

This is a functional component that takes the following props:

- `type`: A string that can be "image", "file", or "file_item". This determines the type of the item to be previewed.
- `item`: The item to be previewed. It can be a `ChatFile`, `MessageImage`, or a `Tables<"file_items">` object.
- `isOpen`: A boolean that determines whether the dialog is open or not.
- `onOpenChange`: A function that is called when the open state of the dialog changes. It takes a boolean parameter that represents the new open state.

The component renders a `Dialog` component with a `DialogContent` child. The content of the dialog depends on the `type` prop:

- If `type` is "image", it renders a `DrawingCanvas` component if the image item has a file, otherwise it renders an `Image` component.
- If `type` is "file_item", it renders a div with the content of the file item.
- If `type` is "file", it renders an `IconFileFilled` component.

## Usage

This component is likely used in a chat interface where users can send images, files, or file items. When a user clicks on an image, file, or file item in a chat message, this component would be used to display a larger preview of the item in a dialog.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The component uses a function inside the JSX to determine what to render based on the `type` prop. This is an interesting way to handle conditional rendering in React. The `cn` function from "@/lib/utils" is used to combine class names for the `DialogContent` component. The `IconFileFilled` component from "@tabler/icons-react" is used to display an icon for file type items.
