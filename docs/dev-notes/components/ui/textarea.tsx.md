# Textarea.tsx

This file is a TypeScript/React module that exports a `Textarea` component. This component is a styled textarea HTML element, which is a part of a form that allows the user to enter larger amounts of text.

## Exports

### `TextareaProps`

This is an interface that extends the `TextareaHTMLAttributes` from React, which includes all the standard properties that a textarea HTML element can have. This allows the `Textarea` component to accept any properties that a regular textarea would.

### `Textarea`

This is a React functional component that uses the `forwardRef` function from React to pass a `ref` to the textarea HTML element. This can be useful in situations where you need to directly interact with the textarea's DOM element for things like managing focus, selection, or animations.

The `Textarea` component accepts all properties defined in the `TextareaProps` interface, as well as a `className` property. The `className` property is used to add additional CSS classes to the textarea.

The component uses the `cn` function from the "@/lib/utils" module to combine the default CSS classes with any additional classes provided through the `className` property.

The default CSS classes provide the following styles:

- A border and background color
- A placeholder text color
- A focus ring when the textarea is focused
- A minimum height of 80 pixels and a full width
- Rounded corners
- Padding
- Small text size
- No outline when focused
- A not-allowed cursor and reduced opacity when disabled

The `Textarea` component also sets its `displayName` property to "Textarea", which can be helpful for debugging, as the display name is used in error messages and logs.

## Usage

You can import and use the `Textarea` component like any other React component. Here's an example:

```jsx
import { Textarea } from './Textarea'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <Textarea placeholder="Enter some text" />
    </form>
  )
}
```

You can also pass a `ref` to the `Textarea` component if you need to interact with the textarea's DOM element:

```jsx
import { Textarea } from './Textarea'
import { useRef } from 'react'

function MyForm() {
  const textareaRef = useRef(null)

  // Use the ref in some way, e.g., to focus the textarea
  useEffect(() => {
    textareaRef.current.focus()
  }, [])

  return (
    <form>
      <Textarea ref={textareaRef} placeholder="Enter some text" />
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `Textarea` component uses the `cn` function to combine CSS classes. This is a common pattern in React and CSS-in-JS libraries to conditionally apply CSS classes. It's interesting to note that this component uses utility classes to style the textarea, which is a common approach in Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.
