# FileIcon.tsx

This TypeScript file is a part of a React project and it exports a functional component named `FileIcon`. The purpose of this component is to display different icons based on the type of file.

## Exports

The file exports a single React functional component `FileIcon`.

### FileIcon

`FileIcon` is a functional component that takes in `FileIconProps` as props and returns a JSX element.

#### Props

`FileIcon` accepts the following props:

- `type` (required): A string that represents the type of the file. Based on this type, the appropriate icon is displayed.
- `size` (optional): A number that represents the size of the icon. If not provided, the default size is 32.

#### Return

The component returns one of the following icons from the `@tabler/icons-react` package, based on the `type` prop:

- `IconPhoto`: If the `type` includes "image".
- `IconFileTypePdf`: If the `type` includes "pdf".
- `IconFileTypeCsv`: If the `type` includes "csv".
- `IconFileTypeDocx`: If the `type` includes "docx".
- `IconFileText`: If the `type` includes "plain".
- `IconJson`: If the `type` includes "json".
- `IconMarkdown`: If the `type` includes "markdown".
- `IconFile`: If the `type` doesn't include any of the above.

## Usage

To use the `FileIcon` component, import it from its module and use it in your JSX code. Pass the `type` prop as a string that includes the type of the file. Optionally, you can also pass the `size` prop to specify the size of the icon.

```jsx
import { FileIcon } from './FileIcon';

// ...

<FileIcon type="image/jpeg" size={48} />
```

In the above example, the `FileIcon` component will display an image icon of size 48.

## Structure and Nuances

The `FileIcon` component uses a series of `if` statements to determine which icon to display based on the `type` prop. If the `type` doesn't match any of the predefined types, a default `IconFile` is returned.

The `size` prop is used to set the size of the icon. If it's not provided, the size defaults to 32.
