# AlertDialog.tsx

This TypeScript file is a part of a React project and it's responsible for creating and managing an Alert Dialog component. It uses the `@radix-ui/react-alert-dialog` package to create the base components of the alert dialog and then customizes them according to the project's requirements.

## Exports

The file exports several components that are used to create a complete alert dialog:

- `AlertDialog`: The root component of the alert dialog.
- `AlertDialogPortal`: A component that renders its children into a new 'subtree' outside of the parent component's DOM hierarchy.
- `AlertDialogOverlay`: A component that creates an overlay for the alert dialog.
- `AlertDialogTrigger`: A component that triggers the alert dialog.
- `AlertDialogContent`: A component that holds the content of the alert dialog.
- `AlertDialogHeader`: A component that represents the header of the alert dialog.
- `AlertDialogFooter`: A component that represents the footer of the alert dialog.
- `AlertDialogTitle`: A component that represents the title of the alert dialog.
- `AlertDialogDescription`: A component that represents the description of the alert dialog.
- `AlertDialogAction`: A component that represents the action button of the alert dialog.
- `AlertDialogCancel`: A component that represents the cancel button of the alert dialog.

## Usage

These components can be used together to create a complete alert dialog. For example, the `AlertDialogTrigger` can be used to trigger the `AlertDialog` which contains `AlertDialogContent` that includes `AlertDialogHeader`, `AlertDialogTitle`, `AlertDialogDescription`, `AlertDialogAction`, and `AlertDialogCancel`.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The file uses the `React.forwardRef` function to create several components. This allows these components to accept a `ref` prop and pass it to the underlying DOM element. This is useful for managing focus, selection, or animations.

The `cn` function is used to conditionally apply CSS classes to the components. This function is imported from the `@/lib/utils` module.

The `buttonVariants` function is used to apply different styles to the `AlertDialogAction` and `AlertDialogCancel` components. This function is imported from the `@/components/ui/button` module.
