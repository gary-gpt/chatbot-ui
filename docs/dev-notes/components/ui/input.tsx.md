# Input.tsx

This file is a TypeScript module that exports a single React component, `Input`. The `Input` component is a wrapper around the standard HTML `input` element, providing additional styling and functionality.

## Exports

### `InputProps`

This is an interface that extends the `React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>` interface. This means that any props you can pass to a standard HTML `input` element, you can also pass to the `Input` component.

### `Input`

This is a React component that renders an `input` element. It uses the `React.forwardRef` function to create a ref that can be passed to the `input` element. This allows the parent component to directly interact with the `input` element if necessary.

The `Input` component accepts all the same props as a standard `input` element, as well as a `className` prop. The `className` prop is combined with a default set of classes using the `cn` function from "@/lib/utils". This allows the component to have a consistent base style, while also allowing additional styles to be added by the parent component.

The `Input` component also sets a `displayName` of "Input". This is useful for debugging, as the component's name will be displayed in the React Developer Tools.

## Usage

To use the `Input` component, you can import it into your component file and use it like any other React component. You can pass any props that you would normally pass to an `input` element, as well as a `className` prop to add additional styles.

```jsx
import { Input } from './Input';

function MyComponent() {
  return <Input type="text" className="my-custom-class" />;
}
```

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `Input` component uses the `cn` function to combine the default classes with any additional classes passed in through the `className` prop. This allows for a lot of flexibility in styling the component, while still maintaining a consistent base style.

The `Input` component also uses the `React.forwardRef` function to create a ref that can be passed to the `input` element. This allows the parent component to directly interact with the `input` element if necessary, which can be useful in certain situations.
