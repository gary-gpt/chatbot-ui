# Alert.tsx

This file defines and exports three React components: `Alert`, `AlertTitle`, and `AlertDescription`. These components are used to create alert messages with a title and description.

## Exports

### Alert

`Alert` is a React component that creates a div with the role of "alert". It uses the `cva` function from the `class-variance-authority` library to define its variants. The `cva` function is used to create a set of class names based on the variant prop. 

The `Alert` component accepts all the standard HTML div attributes (`React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>`) and the variant props (`VariantProps<typeof alertVariants>`). The variant prop can be either "default" or "destructive". The "default" variant has a background color and text color, while the "destructive" variant has a border color, text color, and svg text color.

### AlertTitle

`AlertTitle` is a React component that creates an h5 element. It accepts all the standard HTML heading element attributes (`React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLHeadingElement>`). The class name for this component includes "mb-1", "font-medium", "leading-none", and "tracking-tight".

### AlertDescription

`AlertDescription` is a React component that creates a div. It accepts all the standard HTML paragraph element attributes (`React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLParagraphElement>`). The class name for this component includes "text-sm" and "[&_p]:leading-relaxed".

## Usage

To use these components, import them from the file and use them in your JSX. Here is an example:

```jsx
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from './Alert.tsx';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Alert variant="destructive">
      <AlertTitle>This is the title</AlertTitle>
      <AlertDescription>This is the description</AlertDescription>
    </Alert>
  );
}
```

In this example, an alert with a "destructive" variant is created. The alert has a title and a description.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `Alert` component uses the `cva` function from the `class-variance-authority` library to define its variants. This is a powerful way to create a set of class names based on the variant prop. The `cva` function is used with a string of class names and an object that defines the variants. The resulting function can be called with the variant prop to get the appropriate class names.

The `Alert`, `AlertTitle`, and `AlertDescription` components all use the `React.forwardRef` function to create a ref that can be passed in as a prop. This allows the parent component to access the DOM element directly if necessary.
