# Progress.tsx

This TypeScript file defines a `Progress` component using React and the `@radix-ui/react-progress` library. The `Progress` component is a visual representation of the progress of an operation, such as a file upload or a timer.

## Exports

The file exports the `Progress` component.

## Types

The `Progress` component is a forward-ref React component. It receives all the properties of the `ProgressPrimitive.Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-progress` library, except for the `ref` property. The `ref` property is passed separately to the `React.forwardRef` function.

## Functions

The `Progress` component uses the `cn` function from the `@/lib/utils` module to combine class names.

## Usage

The `Progress` component is used to create a progress bar. The `value` prop determines the current progress. It is a number between 0 and 100, where 0 means no progress and 100 means the operation is complete. The progress bar's appearance is determined by the `className` prop and the `props` object.

The `ProgressPrimitive.Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-progress` library is used as the root element of the `Progress` component. It receives the `ref` prop, the `className` prop, and all other props passed to the `Progress` component.

The `ProgressPrimitive.Indicator` component from the `@radix-ui/react-progress` library is used to indicate the current progress. It receives a `className` prop and a `style` prop. The `style` prop is used to translate the indicator along the x-axis according to the current progress.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `Progress` component uses the `React.forwardRef` function to pass the `ref` prop to the `ProgressPrimitive.Root` component. This allows the parent component to access the DOM element of the `ProgressPrimitive.Root` component directly.

The `Progress` component also uses the `cn` function to combine class names. This is a common pattern in CSS-in-JS libraries to conditionally apply class names.

The `Progress` component sets its `displayName` property to the `displayName` of the `ProgressPrimitive.Root` component. This is a common practice in React to make the component more debuggable.
