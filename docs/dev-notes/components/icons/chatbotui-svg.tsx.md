# ChatbotUISVG.tsx

This TypeScript file defines and exports a React functional component, `ChatbotUISVG`, which renders an SVG image. The SVG image appears to be a chatbot UI icon, and its appearance can be customized based on the provided props.

## Interface: ChatbotUISVGProps

The `ChatbotUISVGProps` interface defines the props that the `ChatbotUISVG` component accepts:

- `theme`: This is a required prop that can either be "dark" or "light". It determines the color scheme of the SVG image.
- `scale`: This is an optional prop that defaults to 1 if not provided. It determines the size of the SVG image.

## Function Component: ChatbotUISVG

The `ChatbotUISVG` component is a React functional component that takes in `ChatbotUISVGProps` as its props. It uses the `theme` prop to determine the fill and stroke colors of the SVG elements, and the `scale` prop to determine the width and height of the SVG.

The SVG itself consists of a rectangle and two paths, which together form the chatbot UI icon. The color scheme and size of the icon can be customized by passing in different `theme` and `scale` props.

## Usage

To use the `ChatbotUISVG` component, import it from its file and use it in your JSX like any other React component. You can pass in `theme` and `scale` props to customize its appearance. For example:

```jsx
import { ChatbotUISVG } from './ChatbotUISVG'

// ...

<ChatbotUISVG theme="dark" scale={2} />
```

This will render a dark-themed chatbot UI icon that is twice the default size.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The SVG paths are hardcoded, which means the shape of the chatbot UI icon is fixed and cannot be changed through props. However, the color scheme and size of the icon can be customized through the `theme` and `scale` props, making this component flexible and reusable in different contexts.
