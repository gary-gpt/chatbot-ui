# GoogleSVG.tsx

This file is a React component that renders a Google logo SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). The SVG is composed of four different paths, each with a different color, to create the Google logo.

## Interface: GoogleSVGProps

The `GoogleSVGProps` interface defines the properties that can be passed to the `GoogleSVG` component. These properties are:

- `height`: (Optional) The height of the SVG. Defaults to 40 if not provided.
- `width`: (Optional) The width of the SVG. Defaults to 40 if not provided.
- `className`: (Optional) A CSS class name that can be applied to the SVG for styling.

## Function Component: GoogleSVG

`GoogleSVG` is a React Function Component that takes `GoogleSVGProps` as its props. It uses these props to set the height, width, and class name of the SVG. 

The SVG itself is composed of four paths, each with a different fill color. These paths are combined to create the Google logo.

### Usage

The `GoogleSVG` component can be used in a React application like any other component. Here's an example:

```jsx
import { GoogleSVG } from './GoogleSVG';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <GoogleSVG height={50} width={50} className="my-google-logo" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `GoogleSVG` component is imported from the `GoogleSVG.tsx` file and used in the `App` component. The height and width are set to 50, and a CSS class name of "my-google-logo" is applied.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The SVG paths used in this component are hard-coded and specific to the Google logo. This means that the component is not generic and can only be used to display the Google logo. However, the height, width, and class name can be customized through the component's props, providing some flexibility in how the logo is displayed.
