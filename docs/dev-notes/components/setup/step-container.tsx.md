# StepContainer.tsx

This TypeScript file defines and exports a functional component `StepContainer` and a constant `SETUP_STEP_COUNT` for a React application. The `StepContainer` component is designed to be a part of a multi-step setup or form process.

## Exports

### `SETUP_STEP_COUNT`

This is a constant that represents the total number of steps in the setup process. It is used within the `StepContainer` component to display the current step number out of the total steps.

### `StepContainer`

This is a functional component that represents a single step in a multi-step process. It is designed to be flexible and reusable, with several props to customize its behavior and appearance.

## Props

The `StepContainer` component accepts the following props:

- `stepDescription`: A string that describes the current step.
- `stepNum`: A number representing the current step number.
- `stepTitle`: A string that provides a title for the current step.
- `onShouldProceed`: A function that is called when the user clicks the "Next" or "Back" button. It receives a boolean argument that indicates whether the user wants to proceed to the next step (`true`) or go back to the previous step (`false`).
- `children`: Any React nodes that should be rendered within the step container.
- `showBackButton`: An optional boolean that determines whether to show the "Back" button. Defaults to `false`.
- `showNextButton`: An optional boolean that determines whether to show the "Next" button. Defaults to `true`.

## Structure

The `StepContainer` component is structured as a `Card` component with a header, content, and footer. The header displays the step title and the current step number out of the total steps. The content displays any child components passed in through the `children` prop. The footer contains "Back" and "Next" buttons, which call the `onShouldProceed` function with `false` and `true` respectively.

## Nuances

The "Next" button is assigned a ref, and a `handleKeyDown` function is defined that simulates a click on this button when the "Enter" key is pressed (without the "Shift" key). This function is passed to the `Card` component's `onKeyDown` prop, providing keyboard accessibility.
