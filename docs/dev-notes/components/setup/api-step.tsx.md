# APIStep.tsx

This TypeScript file defines a React functional component named `APIStep`. This component is used to render a form for inputting various API keys and related configuration values. It supports both OpenAI and Azure OpenAI, with the ability to switch between the two.

## Exports

The file exports a single React functional component `APIStep`.

### APIStep

`APIStep` is a React functional component that takes a set of properties defined by the `APIStepProps` interface. It uses these properties to render a form for inputting various API keys and related configuration values. The form includes fields for OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Mistral, Groq, Perplexity, and OpenRouter API keys.

The component also includes a button to switch between using OpenAI and Azure OpenAI. Depending on the `useAzureOpenai` prop, it will render different sets of input fields.

## APIStepProps

`APIStepProps` is an interface that defines the properties accepted by the `APIStep` component. It includes properties for various API keys and configuration values, as well as callback functions for handling changes to these values.

Each API key and configuration value has a corresponding `onChange` callback function. These functions are expected to take a single string argument (the new value of the input field) and return void. The `onUseAzureOpenaiChange` callback is an exception, as it takes a boolean argument.

## Usage

The `APIStep` component is likely used in a larger form or configuration page where users can input their API keys and other configuration values. When the value of an input field changes, the corresponding `onChange` callback is called with the new value. This allows the parent component to handle the change and update its state as necessary.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `APIStep` component uses conditional rendering based on the `useAzureOpenai` prop to switch between different sets of input fields. If `useAzureOpenai` is true, it renders input fields for Azure OpenAI configuration values. Otherwise, it renders an input field for the OpenAI Organization ID.

The component also includes a button that toggles the `useAzureOpenai` prop. When clicked, it calls the `onUseAzureOpenaiChange` callback with the negated value of `useAzureOpenai`. This allows the parent component to switch between using OpenAI and Azure OpenAI.
