# FinishStep.tsx

This TypeScript file is part of a React project, specifically a component for a chatbot user interface. It exports a functional component named `FinishStep` that is used to display a welcome message to the user and prompt them to start chatting.

## Interface: FinishStepProps

The `FinishStepProps` interface is used to type check the props of the `FinishStep` component. It has one property:

- `displayName`: A string that represents the user's name.

## Component: FinishStep

`FinishStep` is a functional component that takes an object of `FinishStepProps` as its argument. It uses the `displayName` prop to personalize the welcome message. If `displayName` is not an empty string, it will display the first part of the name before the first space (if any).

The component returns a JSX element that contains two divs. The first div displays the welcome message and the user's name (if provided). The second div prompts the user to start chatting.

### Usage

The `FinishStep` component is likely used in a larger component or page that handles the chatbot's user interface. It would be used as the final step in a process, such as user registration or login, before the user starts interacting with the chatbot.

Here is an example of how it might be used:

```jsx
<FinishStep displayName="John Doe" />
```

This would render:

```html
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div>Welcome to Chatbot UI, John!</div>
  <div>Click next to start chatting.</div>
</div>
```

### Interesting Structure or Nuance

The component uses a ternary operator to check if `displayName` is not an empty string. If it isn't, it splits the string at the first space and displays the first part. This assumes that the user's first name is the first part of the `displayName` string, which may not always be the case in different cultures or naming conventions.
