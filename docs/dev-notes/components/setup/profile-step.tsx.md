# ProfileStep.tsx

This TypeScript file defines a `ProfileStep` component which is used to handle user profile setup, specifically the username and display name. It includes validation checks for username availability and length, and provides feedback to the user.

## Exports

The file exports a single component, `ProfileStep`.

### `ProfileStep`

This is a functional component that receives the following props:

- `username`: The current username.
- `usernameAvailable`: A boolean indicating if the current username is available.
- `displayName`: The current display name.
- `onUsernameAvailableChange`: A function to be called when the availability of the username changes.
- `onUsernameChange`: A function to be called when the username changes.
- `onDisplayNameChange`: A function to be called when the display name changes.

The component uses a local state variable `loading` to track whether it's currently checking the availability of a username.

It defines a `debounce` function to prevent rapid, successive calls to the username availability check function, and a `checkUsernameAvailability` function to perform the actual check. This function validates the username against certain criteria (length, character set) and makes a POST request to `/api/username/available` to check if the username is available.

The component's render function returns a JSX structure that includes two input fields for the username and display name, along with labels and feedback elements. The username input field is accompanied by a loading spinner or a check/cross icon to indicate the availability of the username. The `LimitDisplay` component is used to show the user how many characters they have used out of the maximum allowed.

## Usage

This component is likely used in a larger form or step-by-step process for setting up a user profile. The parent component would provide the current username and display name, as well as handlers for when these values change or when the availability of the username changes.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `checkUsernameAvailability` function uses the `useCallback` hook to memoize the function and prevent unnecessary re-renders. It also uses the `debounce` function to limit how often it can be called, which is useful for events like typing in an input field where you don't want to make an API request for every single keystroke.

The component uses the `toast` function from the `sonner` library to display error messages to the user. This is a nice way to provide feedback without interrupting the user's flow.
