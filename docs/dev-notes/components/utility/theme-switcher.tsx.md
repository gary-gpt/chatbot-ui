# ThemeSwitcher.tsx

This TypeScript file is part of a Next.js project and it defines a React functional component named `ThemeSwitcher`. The purpose of this component is to provide a button that allows users to switch between light and dark themes in the application.

## Exports

The file exports a single React functional component, `ThemeSwitcher`.

### ThemeSwitcher

`ThemeSwitcher` is a functional component that doesn't take any props. It uses the `useTheme` hook from `next-themes` to get and set the current theme of the application.

The component defines a `handleChange` function that takes a theme ("dark" or "light") as an argument. This function stores the chosen theme in the local storage and sets the theme using the `setTheme` function from `useTheme`.

The component returns a `Button` component from the `ui/button` module. The button's `onClick` event is set to call the `handleChange` function, passing in the opposite of the current theme. The button displays an icon that corresponds to the current theme: a moon icon for the dark theme and a sun icon for the light theme. The size of the icon is determined by the `SIDEBAR_ICON_SIZE` constant from the `sidebar/sidebar-switcher` module.

## Usage

To use the `ThemeSwitcher` component, import it from its module and include it in the JSX of a parent component. When the button is clicked, it will switch the theme of the application and update the local storage.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `ThemeSwitcher` component uses the `useTheme` hook from `next-themes`, which is a library for enabling dark mode in Next.js applications. It also uses the `localStorage` Web API to persist the user's theme preference across sessions.

The component uses a ternary operator to determine which icon to display and what theme to switch to when the button is clicked. This is a concise way to handle the two possible states of the theme.
