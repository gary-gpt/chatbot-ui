# providers.tsx

The `providers.tsx` file is a TypeScript file that is used to provide theme and tooltip functionality to the child components in a React application. It uses the `ThemeProvider` from the `next-themes` package and the `TooltipProvider` from the local `@/components/ui/tooltip` module.

## Exports

This file exports a single constant, `Providers`, which is a Functional Component (FC) in React. It accepts the props of type `ThemeProviderProps` from the `next-themes/dist/types` module.

## Usage

The `Providers` component is used to wrap other components that require theme and tooltip functionality. The `children` prop, which represents the child components, is passed to the `TooltipProvider` and then to the `NextThemesProvider`. This means that all child components will have access to the theme and tooltip context provided by these providers.

Here's an example of how it might be used:

```tsx
import { Providers } from './providers.tsx';
import { SomeComponent } from './SomeComponent.tsx';

function App() {
  return (
    <Providers>
      <SomeComponent />
    </Providers>
  );
}
```

In this example, `SomeComponent` will have access to the theme and tooltip context.

## Structure

The `Providers` component uses the render props pattern, where the `children` prop is a function that returns a React element. This pattern is used to share code between React components using a prop whose value is a function.

## Nuances

The `...props` syntax in the `Providers` component is a JavaScript spread operator that is used to pass down any additional props to the `NextThemesProvider`. This allows for flexibility in providing additional props to the `NextThemesProvider` without explicitly defining each one in the `Providers` component.
