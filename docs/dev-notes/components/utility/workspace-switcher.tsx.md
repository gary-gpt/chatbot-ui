# WorkspaceSwitcher.tsx

This TypeScript file defines a component named `WorkspaceSwitcher` that allows users to switch between different workspaces in a chatbot UI. It also provides functionality to create new workspaces.

## Exports

The file exports a single component, `WorkspaceSwitcher`.

## Types

The file defines an empty `WorkspaceSwitcherProps` interface, which is used as the type for the props of the `WorkspaceSwitcher` component. This suggests that the component does not accept any props.

## Functions

The `WorkspaceSwitcher` component uses several functions:

- `handleCreateWorkspace`: This function creates a new workspace with default settings and adds it to the list of workspaces. It then sets the newly created workspace as the selected workspace and navigates to its chat page.

- `getWorkspaceName`: This function takes a workspace ID and returns the name of the corresponding workspace.

- `handleSelect`: This function takes a workspace ID, sets the corresponding workspace as the selected workspace, and navigates to its chat page.

## Usage

The `WorkspaceSwitcher` component is likely used in a larger chatbot UI. When rendered, it displays a popover that lists all available workspaces. Users can switch between workspaces by clicking on them in the list. They can also create new workspaces by clicking the "New Workspace" button.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The component uses several hooks to manage its state and side effects:

- `useHotkey`: This hook is used to toggle the popover when the semicolon key is pressed.

- `useContext`: This hook is used to access the `ChatbotUIContext`, which provides the current state of the chatbot UI and functions to update it.

- `useRouter`: This hook is used to navigate to different pages in the application.

- `useState` and `useEffect`: These hooks are used to manage the component's local state and side effects.

The component also uses several third-party components and icons to build its UI. For example, it uses the `Popover`, `PopoverContent`, and `PopoverTrigger` components from `@/components/ui/popover` to create the popover, and the `IconBuilding`, `IconHome`, and `IconPlus` icons from `@tabler/icons-react` and `ChevronsUpDown` from `lucide-react` to display icons in the UI.
