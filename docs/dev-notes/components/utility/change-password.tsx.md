# ChangePassword.tsx

This TypeScript file defines a React functional component `ChangePassword` that provides a user interface for changing a user's password. The component is designed to be used in a Next.js application with Supabase as the backend.

## Imports

The file imports several dependencies:

- `supabase` from "@/lib/supabase/browser-client" - This is the Supabase client used for interacting with the Supabase backend.
- `useRouter` from "next/navigation" - This is a hook provided by Next.js for accessing the router.
- `FC, useState` from "react" - These are React exports for defining a functional component and using state within it.
- `Button` from "../ui/button" - This is a UI component for a button.
- `Dialog, DialogContent, DialogFooter, DialogHeader, DialogTitle` from "../ui/dialog" - These are UI components for creating a dialog.
- `Input` from "../ui/input" - This is a UI component for an input field.
- `toast` from "sonner" - This is a library for displaying notifications.

## Exports

The file exports a single functional component `ChangePassword`. This component does not take any props.

## Component Structure

The `ChangePassword` component uses the `useState` hook to manage two pieces of state: `newPassword` and `confirmPassword`. These represent the new password the user wants to set and the confirmation of that password.

The component defines a single function `handleResetPassword`. This function checks if a new password has been entered, updates the user's password using the Supabase client, displays a success notification, and then redirects the user to the login page.

The component's render method returns a `Dialog` component. Inside the dialog, there are two `Input` components for the new password and the confirmation of the new password. There is also a `Button` component that, when clicked, calls the `handleResetPassword` function.

## Usage

This component is likely used in a larger application where it is rendered when a user wants to change their password. The user would enter their new password, confirm it, and then click the "Confirm Change" button to update their password. After the password is updated, they would be redirected to the login page.

## Nuances

The `handleResetPassword` function does not check if the new password and the confirmation match. This is something that might be expected in a password change form and could be added.
