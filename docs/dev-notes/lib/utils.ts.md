# Source File Documentation

## Filename: `utilities.js`

This file is a utility module that exports several helper functions. These functions are used for various purposes such as class merging, date formatting, and data URL parsing.

### Exports

#### `cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]): string`

This function takes any number of arguments of type `ClassValue` and merges them into a single string. It uses the `clsx` function to combine the class values and the `twMerge` function from the `tailwind-merge` library to merge Tailwind CSS classes. This function is useful when you need to conditionally apply CSS classes.

#### `formatDate(input: string | number | Date): string`

This function takes an input of either a string, a number, or a `Date` object and returns a formatted date string. The date is formatted as "Month Day, Year" (e.g., "December 31, 2021"). This function is useful when you need to display dates in a human-readable format.

#### `getMediaTypeFromDataURL(dataURL: string): string | null`

This function takes a data URL as input and returns the media type of the data. If the media type cannot be extracted, it returns `null`. This function is useful when you need to determine the media type of data encoded in a data URL.

#### `getBase64FromDataURL(dataURL: string): string | null`

This function takes a data URL as input and returns the base64 encoded data. If the data cannot be extracted, it returns `null`. This function is useful when you need to extract the base64 data from a data URL.

### Usage

These utility functions can be imported and used in other parts of the application where needed. For example, the `cn` function can be used to merge CSS classes, the `formatDate` function can be used to format dates for display, and the `getMediaTypeFromDataURL` and `getBase64FromDataURL` functions can be used to parse data URLs.

### Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `cn` function uses the `clsx` and `twMerge` libraries to merge class names, which is a common requirement in CSS-in-JS solutions. The `formatDate` function uses the built-in `toLocaleDateString` method of the `Date` object, which is a convenient way to format dates in JavaScript. The `getMediaTypeFromDataURL` and `getBase64FromDataURL` functions use regular expressions to parse data URLs, which is a common technique for parsing strings in JavaScript.
