# convertBlobToBase64.ts

This TypeScript file exports a single function `convertBlobToBase64`. The purpose of this function is to convert a Blob object into a Base64 string. This is often used in situations where binary data needs to be handled as a string, such as when sending the data over a network or storing it in a text-based format like JSON.

## Exported Function

### `convertBlobToBase64(blob: Blob): Promise<string>`

This function takes a Blob object as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves to a string. The returned string is the Base64 representation of the input Blob.

The function uses the FileReader API to read the Blob as a data URL, which is a Base64 encoded string. It sets up event handlers for the `onloadend` and `onerror` events of the FileReader. When the read operation is complete, the `onloadend` event is fired, and the function resolves the Promise with the result of the read operation. If an error occurs during the read operation, the `onerror` event is fired, and the function rejects the Promise.

## Usage

This function is asynchronous and returns a Promise, so it should be used with the `await` keyword in an async function, or with `then` and `catch` methods. Here is an example of how to use this function:

```typescript
const blob = new Blob(['Hello, world!'], { type: 'text/plain' });
convertBlobToBase64(blob)
  .then(base64 => console.log(base64))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

In this example, a Blob object is created from a string, and then it is converted to a Base64 string. The resulting Base64 string is logged to the console. If an error occurs during the conversion, the error is logged to the console.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The function uses the FileReader API, which is part of the File API. This API provides a way to read in-browser file data in JavaScript. The `readAsDataURL` method is used to start reading the contents of the specified Blob or File. When the read operation is finished, the `onloadend` event is fired, and the `result` attribute contains a data: URL representing the file's data.
