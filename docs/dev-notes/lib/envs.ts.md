# isUsingEnvironmentKey.ts

This TypeScript file is a utility module that provides a function to check if a specific environment key is present in the environment variables of the running process.

## Function: isUsingEnvironmentKey

The `isUsingEnvironmentKey` function is the only export of this file. It takes an `EnvKey` type as an argument and checks if this key is present in the environment variables of the process. 

### Parameters

- `type` (`EnvKey`): The environment key to check for. `EnvKey` is a type imported from "@/types/key-type".

### Return Value

The function returns a boolean value. It will return `true` if the key is found in the environment variables, and `false` if it is not.

### Usage

This function is used to determine if a specific environment key is being used in the current process. It can be used in any part of the application where such a check is necessary. Here is a basic example of how to use this function:

```typescript
import { isUsingEnvironmentKey } from './isUsingEnvironmentKey'

if (isUsingEnvironmentKey('MY_ENV_KEY')) {
  console.log('The key MY_ENV_KEY is present in the environment variables.')
} else {
  console.log('The key MY_ENV_KEY is not present in the environment variables.')
}
```

In this example, the function `isUsingEnvironmentKey` is used to check if the 'MY_ENV_KEY' is present in the environment variables. The result of this check is then logged to the console.

### Interesting Structure or Nuance

The function uses the `Boolean` constructor as a function to convert the value returned by `process.env[type]` to a boolean. This is a common JavaScript idiom for converting a value to a boolean. If `process.env[type]` is undefined (which means the key is not present in the environment variables), `Boolean(undefined)` will return `false`. If `process.env[type]` has a value (which means the key is present in the environment variables), `Boolean(value)` will return `true`.
