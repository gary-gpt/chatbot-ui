# processMarkdown.ts

The `processMarkdown.ts` file is a TypeScript module that exports a single function, `processMarkdown`. This function is used to process a Markdown file and split it into chunks of text, which are then tokenized.

## Function: processMarkdown

The `processMarkdown` function is an asynchronous function that takes a Blob (representing a Markdown file) as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

### Parameters

- `markdown`: A Blob object representing the Markdown file to be processed.

### Returns

A Promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects. Each `FileItemChunk` object contains the following properties:

- `content`: A string representing a chunk of the Markdown file.
- `tokens`: The number of tokens in the chunk, as determined by the `encode` function from the `gpt-tokenizer` module.

### How It Works

The function begins by converting the Blob into a Buffer and then decoding it into a string using the `TextDecoder` object with "utf-8" encoding.

Next, it creates an instance of `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from the `langchain/text_splitter` module. This instance is configured to split the text into chunks of a specific size (`CHUNK_SIZE`), with a certain amount of overlap between chunks (`CHUNK_OVERLAP`).

The function then uses the `splitter` to split the decoded text into documents. Each document represents a chunk of the original Markdown file.

Finally, the function iterates over the documents, pushing a new `FileItemChunk` object for each one onto the `chunks` array. Each `FileItemChunk` object contains the content of the document and the number of tokens in the content (as determined by the `encode` function).

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `processMarkdown` function uses the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the Markdown file into chunks. This is a recursive process, meaning that it continues to split the text until it reaches chunks of the specified size. The use of recursion in this context is interesting because it allows for a more granular level of text splitting than would be possible with a simple linear approach.

The function also uses the `encode` function from the `gpt-tokenizer` module to count the number of tokens in each chunk. This is a useful feature for natural language processing tasks, as it provides a measure of the complexity of the text in each chunk.
