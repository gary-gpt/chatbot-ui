# File: index.ts

This TypeScript file serves as the main entry point for a module that handles various file formats. It exports all the functionalities from the modules for handling CSV, DOCX, JSON, Markdown (MD), PDF, and TXT files. 

## Exports

The file exports all the functions, types, and constants from the following modules:

- `csv`: This module likely contains functions and types for working with CSV files.
- `docx`: This module likely contains functions and types for working with DOCX files.
- `json`: This module likely contains functions and types for working with JSON files.
- `md`: This module likely contains functions and types for working with Markdown files.
- `pdf`: This module likely contains functions and types for working with PDF files.
- `txt`: This module likely contains functions and types for working with TXT files.

In addition, this file exports two constants:

- `CHUNK_SIZE`: This constant likely defines the size of a chunk when the file is being processed in chunks. The value is set to 4000, but the units (e.g., bytes, lines) are not specified in this file.
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP`: This constant likely defines the overlap between chunks when the file is being processed in chunks. The value is set to 200, but the units are not specified in this file.

## Usage

While the specific usage of this file depends on the functionalities provided by the individual modules, generally, you would import the required functions, types, or constants from this module in another TypeScript file like so:

```typescript
import { someFunction, someType, CHUNK_SIZE } from './index';
```

## Structure and Nuance

This file uses the `export * from` syntax to re-export all exports from the individual modules. This is a common pattern in TypeScript and JavaScript projects to create a "barrel" that collects exports from several modules into a single convenient module.

The constants `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP` are likely used in the processing of files, possibly when reading in data in chunks for efficiency reasons. The exact details would depend on the implementation in the individual modules.
