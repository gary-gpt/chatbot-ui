# processJSON.ts

This TypeScript file is responsible for processing JSON files into chunks of text. It exports a single asynchronous function `processJSON` that takes a JSON blob as input and returns a promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

## Exports

### processJSON

This is an asynchronous function that takes a JSON blob as an argument and returns a `Promise<FileItemChunk[]>`. 

The function works as follows:

1. It creates a new instance of `JSONLoader` with the provided JSON blob and loads the documents from it.
2. It concatenates the `pageContent` of all the documents into a single string.
3. It creates a new instance of `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with a specified `chunkSize` and `chunkOverlap`.
4. It splits the concatenated text into chunks using the `createDocuments` method of the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` instance.
5. It then iterates over the split documents, encoding each document's `pageContent` into tokens and pushing a new `FileItemChunk` object into the `chunks` array for each document. Each `FileItemChunk` object contains the `pageContent` and the number of tokens in the content.
6. Finally, it returns the `chunks` array.

## Types

### FileItemChunk

This is a type imported from "@/types". Each `FileItemChunk` object represents a chunk of text and contains two properties: `content` and `tokens`. `content` is a string representing the text content of the chunk, and `tokens` is a number representing the number of tokens in the content.

## Usage

This file is used to process JSON files into chunks of text. The `processJSON` function can be imported into other TypeScript files and used to process JSON blobs. The function returns a promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects, which can then be used for further processing or analysis.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `processJSON` function uses the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the text into chunks. This splitter allows for overlapping chunks, which can be useful for certain types of text analysis. The size of the chunks and the amount of overlap are defined by the `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP` constants, respectively.
