# processPdf.ts

This file is responsible for processing PDF files into chunks of text. It uses a variety of imported modules to load the PDF, split the text into chunks, and then encode these chunks into tokens. The main function exported by this file is `processPdf`.

## Exports

### `processPdf`

This is an asynchronous function that takes a PDF file as input and returns a promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects. 

A `FileItemChunk` object is defined in another module and is expected to have the following structure:

```typescript
{
  content: string, // The actual text content of the chunk
  tokens: number  // The number of tokens in the chunk
}
```

The `processPdf` function works as follows:

1. It creates a new `PDFLoader` instance with the input PDF and loads the document.
2. It combines all the page contents into a single string.
3. It creates a new `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` instance with predefined `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP` values.
4. It splits the combined text into chunks using the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`.
5. It iterates over each chunk, encodes the chunk content into tokens using the `gpt-tokenizer`'s `encode` function, and pushes a new `FileItemChunk` object to an array.
6. Finally, it returns the array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

## Usage

This file is likely used in a larger system where PDF documents need to be processed and tokenized for further analysis or processing. The `processPdf` function would be imported and called with a PDF file as an argument.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` is used to split the text into chunks. This suggests that the text is split recursively until the chunks are of a certain size (`CHUNK_SIZE`). There's also an overlap between chunks (`CHUNK_OVERLAP`), which means that some characters at the end of one chunk may also appear at the beginning of the next chunk. This could be useful in ensuring that no meaningful information is lost at the boundaries between chunks.

The `gpt-tokenizer`'s `encode` function is used to convert the chunk content into tokens. This suggests that the system may be using a GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model or a similar language model that requires tokenized input.
