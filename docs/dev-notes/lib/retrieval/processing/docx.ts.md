# processDocX.ts

The `processDocX.ts` file is a part of a larger project that processes text from a DocX file. It splits the text into chunks and encodes each chunk into tokens using the `gpt-tokenizer` library. The chunk size and overlap are configurable.

## Exports

This file exports a single asynchronous function `processDocX`.

### processDocX

The `processDocX` function takes a string of text as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

```typescript
export const processDocX = async (text: string): Promise<FileItemChunk[]> => {...}
```

The function uses the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from the `langchain/text_splitter` library to split the text into chunks. The size and overlap of the chunks are defined by the `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP` constants.

After splitting the text, the function loops through each chunk, encodes it into tokens using the `gpt-tokenizer` library, and pushes a new `FileItemChunk` object to the `chunks` array. Each `FileItemChunk` object contains the chunk content and the number of tokens.

## Types

### FileItemChunk

The `FileItemChunk` type is imported from the "@/types" module. It's an object type that contains two properties:

- `content`: a string that represents the chunk content.
- `tokens`: a number that represents the number of tokens in the chunk.

```typescript
type FileItemChunk = {
  content: string,
  tokens: number
}
```

## Usage

To use the `processDocX` function, import it from its module, and call it with a string of text. The function returns a Promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

```typescript
import { processDocX } from './processDocX'

const text = '...'
const chunks = await processDocX(text)
```

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `processDocX` function uses the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the text into chunks. This splitter is interesting because it splits the text recursively, which means it can handle large amounts of text efficiently. The chunk size and overlap are configurable, which provides flexibility in how the text is split.
