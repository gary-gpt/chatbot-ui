# processTxt.ts

This TypeScript file is responsible for processing text files (txt). It reads the content of the text file, splits it into chunks, and then encodes each chunk into tokens. The chunks and their corresponding tokens are then returned as an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

## Exports

The file exports a single asynchronous function `processTxt`.

### processTxt

This function takes a `Blob` object as an argument, which represents the text file to be processed. It returns a `Promise` that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

The `FileItemChunk` type is imported from the "@/types" module and it's an object that contains the content of the chunk and the number of tokens in the chunk.

## Usage

The `processTxt` function is used to process a text file and split it into chunks. The function first reads the content of the text file using the `TextDecoder` object. It then uses the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` object to split the text content into chunks. The size and overlap of the chunks are defined by the `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP` constants.

The function then loops over each chunk, encodes it into tokens using the `encode` function from the "gpt-tokenizer" module, and pushes a `FileItemChunk` object to the `chunks` array. The `FileItemChunk` object contains the content of the chunk and the number of tokens in the chunk.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` object is used to split the text content into chunks. This object takes an options object as an argument, which defines the size and overlap of the chunks. The `createDocuments` method of the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` object is then used to create the chunks.

The `encode` function from the "gpt-tokenizer" module is used to encode each chunk into tokens. The length of the resulting array of tokens is then used as the number of tokens in the chunk.

The function uses the `Buffer.from` method to create a buffer from the `ArrayBuffer` of the text file. This is necessary because the `TextDecoder` object requires a buffer as an argument.
