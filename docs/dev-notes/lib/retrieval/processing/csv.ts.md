# processCSV.ts

This file is responsible for processing CSV files into chunks of text and tokens. It uses several imported modules and constants to achieve this.

## Imports

- `FileItemChunk` from "@/types": This is a type that represents a chunk of a file item.
- `encode` from "gpt-tokenizer": This function is used to tokenize the content of a document.
- `CSVLoader` from "langchain/document_loaders/fs/csv": This is a class that loads CSV files.
- `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` from "langchain/text_splitter": This class is used to split text into chunks.
- `CHUNK_OVERLAP` and `CHUNK_SIZE` from ".": These are constants that define the size of the chunks and the overlap between them.

## Exports

The file exports a single asynchronous function, `processCSV`, which takes a CSV file as input and returns a promise that resolves to an array of `FileItemChunk` objects.

## Functions

### processCSV

This function takes a `Blob` representing a CSV file as an argument and returns a `Promise<FileItemChunk[]>`. It processes the CSV file and splits it into chunks of text and tokens.

The function works as follows:

1. It creates a new `CSVLoader` with the input CSV file and loads the documents from it.
2. It joins the content of all the documents into a single string, `completeText`.
3. It creates a new `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with the `CHUNK_SIZE`, `CHUNK_OVERLAP`, and `separators` parameters.
4. It uses the splitter to split `completeText` into documents.
5. It iterates over the split documents and for each one, it creates a `FileItemChunk` with the content of the document and the number of tokens in it (obtained by encoding the content with `encode`).
6. It returns an array with all the created `FileItemChunk` objects.

## Usage

This file is likely used in a larger system that processes CSV files. The `processCSV` function can be used to process a CSV file and obtain an array of `FileItemChunk` objects, which contain chunks of the content of the file and the number of tokens in each chunk. This can be useful for tasks such as text analysis or machine learning.
