# createClient.js

This JavaScript file is part of a project that uses Supabase, a popular open-source Firebase alternative. It's specifically designed to work with server-side rendering (SSR) environments, such as Next.js.

## Overview

The file exports a single function, `createClient`, which is a wrapper around the `createBrowserClient` function from the `@supabase/ssr` package. This function is used to create a new Supabase client for interacting with a Supabase backend.

## Exports

### `createClient`

This is a function that takes no parameters and returns a new Supabase client. The client is created by calling the `createBrowserClient` function with two arguments:

- `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: This is the URL of the Supabase backend. It's expected to be set in the environment variables, specifically as a public variable in a Next.js application.
- `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: This is the anonymous key for the Supabase backend. Like the URL, it's also expected to be set in the environment variables.

Both of these environment variables are required (as indicated by the `!` after their names), so the function will throw an error if either of them is not set.

## Usage

To use this file, you would typically import the `createClient` function into your server-side rendered JavaScript or TypeScript file, and then call it to create a new Supabase client. Here's an example:

```javascript
import { createClient } from './createClient'

const supabase = createClient()
```

Once you have the `supabase` client, you can use it to interact with your Supabase backend.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

This file is a good example of how to handle sensitive data such as URLs and keys in a secure way. By storing these values in environment variables, they can be kept out of the codebase, reducing the risk of them being exposed. The use of the `!` operator after the environment variables is a TypeScript feature that asserts that the variables will not be `null` or `undefined`, which is a way of ensuring that these critical values have been set.
