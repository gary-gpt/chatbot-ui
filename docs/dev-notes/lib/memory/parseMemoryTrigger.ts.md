# lib/memory/parseMemoryTrigger.ts

This file is part of a larger JavaScript/TypeScript project and is located in the `lib/memory` directory. The file is named `parseMemoryTrigger.ts` and its main purpose is to parse memory triggers.

## Exported Function: parseMemoryTrigger

The file exports a single function named `parseMemoryTrigger`. This function accepts a single argument, `_input`, which is a string. The function returns an object with the following properties:

- `isMemoryTrigger`: a boolean value indicating whether the input is a memory trigger.
- `memoryContent`: a string representing the content of the memory.
- `tags`: an optional string that may contain tags related to the memory.
- `category`: an optional string that may contain the category of the memory.
- `needsConfirmation`: an optional boolean value indicating whether the memory trigger needs confirmation.

### Usage

The `parseMemoryTrigger` function is likely used in the context of a larger system that deals with memory triggers. The function's input and output suggest that it is used to parse some form of input (possibly user input) into a structured memory trigger object.

### Current State: Stub

Currently, the `parseMemoryTrigger` function is a stub, meaning it is a placeholder for the actual implementation. The function always returns an object with default values, regardless of the input. This is indicated by the comment "TEMP STUB â€” Memory trigger system disabled for modular testing". This suggests that the function's current implementation is temporary and is likely to change in the future.

### Interesting Structure or Nuance

The function uses TypeScript's type annotation feature to specify the shape of the object it returns. This can be useful for developers working with this function, as it provides clear expectations about the function's output. However, since the function is currently a stub, these type annotations do not reflect the function's actual behavior.
