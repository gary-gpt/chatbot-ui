# getServerProfile.ts

This TypeScript file is part of a larger project that interacts with a Supabase database. It exports three functions: `getServerProfile`, `addApiKeysToProfile`, and `checkApiKey`. 

## getServerProfile

This asynchronous function retrieves a user's profile from a Supabase database. It first creates a server client with the Supabase URL and anonymous key from the environment variables. It then retrieves the user's profile from the 'profiles' table in the database using the user's id. If the user or the profile is not found, it throws an error. Finally, it adds API keys to the profile using the `addApiKeysToProfile` function and returns the profile.

## addApiKeysToProfile

This function takes a profile as an argument and adds API keys to it. It creates an object `apiKeys` that maps environment variable keys to profile keys. It then iterates over this object and for each entry, if the environment variable exists, it adds the value of the environment variable to the profile using the corresponding profile key. It then returns the updated profile.

## checkApiKey

This function checks if an API key is present. It takes two arguments: the API key and the key name. If the API key is null or an empty string, it throws an error indicating that the API key was not found.

## Usage

These functions are likely used in a server-side environment where user profiles are retrieved and manipulated. The `getServerProfile` function could be used to retrieve a user's profile, which is then passed to the `addApiKeysToProfile` function to add the necessary API keys. The `checkApiKey` function could be used to validate the presence of an API key before it is used in an API request.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `addApiKeysToProfile` function uses the bracket notation to add properties to the profile object. This allows the function to dynamically add properties to the object based on the keys in the `apiKeys` object. This is a flexible approach that can easily accommodate changes in the API keys that need to be added to the profile.
