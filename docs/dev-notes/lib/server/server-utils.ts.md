# createResponse.ts

This TypeScript file exports a single function `createResponse`. The purpose of this function is to create a new `Response` object with a given data object and status code. The data object is converted to a JSON string and set as the body of the response. The status code is used as the HTTP status code of the response. The `Content-Type` of the response is set to `application/json`.

## Exported Function

### createResponse

This function takes two parameters: `data` and `status`.

- `data` (object): This is the data that will be included in the body of the response. It is converted to a JSON string before being included in the response.
- `status` (number): This is the HTTP status code that will be used for the response.

The function returns a new `Response` object with the given data and status. The `Content-Type` of the response is set to `application/json`.

## Usage

This function is used to create a `Response` object with a given data object and status code. Here's an example of how it might be used:

```typescript
import { createResponse } from './createResponse';

const data = { message: 'Hello, world!' };
const status = 200;

const response = createResponse(data, status);
```

In this example, `response` would be a `Response` object with a body of `{"message":"Hello, world!"}` and a status code of `200`.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The function `createResponse` uses the `Response` constructor to create a new `Response` object. This constructor is a part of the Fetch API, which provides an interface for fetching resources across the network. The `Response` constructor creates a new `Response` object representing the response to a request.

The `Response` constructor takes two arguments: `body` and `init`. In the `createResponse` function, `body` is the JSON string representation of the `data` parameter, and `init` is an object with properties `status` and `headers`. The `headers` property is an object with a single property `Content-Type`, which is set to `application/json`. This means that the response will have a `Content-Type` header of `application/json`, indicating that the body of the response is in JSON format.
