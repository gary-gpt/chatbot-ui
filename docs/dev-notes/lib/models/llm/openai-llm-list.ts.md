# OpenAI Models File Documentation

This file defines and exports a list of OpenAI models. Each model is represented as an object with specific properties such as `modelId`, `modelName`, `provider`, `hostedId`, `platformLink`, `imageInput`, and `pricing`. The `pricing` property itself is an object that includes `currency`, `unit`, `inputCost`, and `outputCost`.

## Constants

The file defines several constants, each representing a different OpenAI model:

- `GPT4o`
- `GPT4Turbo`
- `GPT4Vision`
- `GPT4`
- `GPT3_5Turbo`

Each of these constants is an object of type `LLM`, which is imported from "@/types". The `LLM` type is not defined in this file, but it appears to be a structured type that includes properties for identifying the model, its provider, whether it accepts image input, and its pricing details.

## Exports

The file exports a single constant, `OPENAI_LLM_LIST`, which is an array of `LLM` objects. This array includes all the OpenAI models defined in the file.

## Usage

This file is likely used in the context of an application that interacts with OpenAI's API. The `OPENAI_LLM_LIST` could be used to display a list of available models, or to programmatically interact with different models based on their properties.

## Structure and Nuance

Each model object includes a `platformLink` property, which is set to the constant `OPENAI_PLATORM_LINK`. This suggests that all models are available on the same platform, and this link could be used to direct users to more information about the models.

The `pricing` property of each model is an object that includes `currency`, `unit`, `inputCost`, and `outputCost`. This suggests that the cost of using each model may vary based on the amount of input and output data, measured in "tokens". Not all models include an `outputCost`, which may indicate that some models do not charge for output data.

The `imageInput` property is a boolean that indicates whether the model accepts image input. This could be used to filter models based on the type of input data they accept.
