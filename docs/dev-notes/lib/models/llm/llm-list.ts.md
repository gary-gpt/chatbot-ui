# llm-list.ts

## Overview

The `llm-list.ts` file is a part of a JavaScript/TypeScript project that manages and exports lists of Language Models (LLMs) from various sources. The sources include OpenAI, Google, Mistral, Groq, Perplexity, and Anthropic.

## Exports

The file exports two main constants: `LLM_LIST` and `LLM_LIST_MAP`.

### LLM_LIST

`LLM_LIST` is an array of LLM objects. It is a combined list of all LLMs from all the sources. The spread operator (`...`) is used to concatenate arrays from each source into one array.

### LLM_LIST_MAP

`LLM_LIST_MAP` is an object where each key is a string representing the source of the LLMs and the value is an array of LLMs from that source. This provides a way to access the list of LLMs from a specific source.

## Types

The `LLM` type is imported from "@/types". This type is used to type the arrays of LLMs.

## Usage

The `LLM_LIST` and `LLM_LIST_MAP` constants can be imported into other files in the project to use the list of LLMs. The `LLM_LIST` can be used when the LLMs from all sources are needed, while `LLM_LIST_MAP` can be used to get LLMs from a specific source.

## Structure and Nuance

The file imports lists of LLMs from different sources and combines them into a single list and a map. This structure allows for easy access to all LLMs or LLMs from a specific source. The use of the spread operator to combine arrays and the `Record` type to create the map are interesting nuances in this file.
