# GoogleLLMList.ts

This TypeScript file is part of a larger project that interacts with machine learning models provided by Google. It defines and exports a list of these models, each represented as an object of type `LLM`.

## Constants

The file defines several constants, each representing a specific machine learning model:

- `GEMINI_1_5_FLASH`
- `GEMINI_1_5_PRO`
- `GEMINI_PRO`
- `GEMINI_PRO_VISION`

Each of these constants is an object of type `LLM`, which presumably represents a machine learning model. The `LLM` type is not defined in this file, but is imported from "@/types", indicating that it is a shared type used across multiple files in this project.

Each `LLM` object includes the following properties:

- `modelId`: A unique identifier for the model.
- `modelName`: A human-readable name for the model.
- `provider`: The provider of the model, in this case always "google".
- `hostedId`: Another identifier for the model, which may be used when interacting with the model on the provider's platform.
- `platformLink`: A link to the provider's platform, in this case always "https://ai.google.dev/".
- `imageInput`: A boolean indicating whether the model accepts image input.

## Exports

The file exports a single constant, `GOOGLE_LLM_LIST`, which is an array containing all of the `LLM` objects defined in the file. This list can be imported by other files in the project that need to interact with these models.

## Usage

While the file does not contain any functions or methods, its usage can be inferred from its structure. Other parts of the project can import `GOOGLE_LLM_LIST` to get a list of the available Google machine learning models. Each model can then be accessed by its `modelId` or `hostedId`, and the `platformLink` can be used to interact with the model on Google's platform. The `imageInput` property can be used to determine whether the model accepts image input.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The file includes comments indicating when each model was last updated. This suggests that the models may be updated regularly, and that this file may need to be updated to reflect those changes. The `modelId` and `hostedId` for each model are similar, but not always identical, suggesting that they serve different purposes.
