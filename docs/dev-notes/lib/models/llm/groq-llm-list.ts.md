# groq_llm.ts

This file defines and exports a list of machine learning models provided by Groq, a platform for machine learning models. Each model is represented as an object of type `LLM`, which contains various properties such as the model's ID, name, provider, and pricing information.

## Constants

The file defines several constants:

- `GROQ_PLATORM_LINK`: A string that represents the URL of the Groq platform.
- `LLaMA3_8B`, `LLaMA3_70B`, `MIXTRAL_8X7B`, `GEMMA_7B_IT`: Objects of type `LLM` that represent specific machine learning models provided by Groq.

## `LLM` Type

The `LLM` type is an object with the following properties:

- `modelId`: A string that represents the ID of the model.
- `modelName`: A string that represents the name of the model.
- `provider`: A string that represents the provider of the model.
- `hostedId`: A string that represents the hosted ID of the model.
- `platformLink`: A string that represents the link to the platform where the model is hosted.
- `imageInput`: A boolean that indicates whether the model accepts image input.
- `pricing`: An object that contains pricing information for the model, including the currency, unit, input cost, and output cost.

## Exports

The file exports the following:

- `GROQ_LLM_LIST`: An array of `LLM` objects that represents a list of machine learning models provided by Groq.

## Usage

This file is likely used in a larger application where the list of machine learning models is needed. For example, it could be used to display a list of available models on a user interface, or to programmatically interact with the models on the Groq platform.

## Structure and Nuance

Each `LLM` object is defined separately and then included in the `GROQ_LLM_LIST` array. This structure makes it easy to add, remove, or modify models in the list. The pricing information for each model is included as a nested object within the `LLM` object, which organizes related data together and makes the structure of the data clear.
