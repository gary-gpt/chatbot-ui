# mistralModels.ts

This TypeScript file defines and exports a list of Mistral models. Each model is represented as an object of type `LLM` (imported from "@/types"). The models are defined with various properties such as `modelId`, `modelName`, `provider`, `hostedId`, `platformLink`, and `imageInput`. Some models also include a `pricing` object.

## Exports

The file exports a single constant, `MISTRAL_LLM_LIST`, which is an array of `LLM` objects. Each object in this array represents a different Mistral model.

## Types

The `LLM` type is used to define the structure of the Mistral models. It includes the following properties:

- `modelId`: A string that uniquely identifies the model.
- `modelName`: A string that provides the name of the model.
- `provider`: A string that specifies the provider of the model.
- `hostedId`: A string that provides the hosted ID of the model.
- `platformLink`: A string that provides a link to the platform where the model is hosted.
- `imageInput`: A boolean that indicates whether the model accepts image input.
- `pricing`: An optional object that provides pricing information for the model. This object includes `currency`, `unit`, `inputCost`, and `outputCost` properties.

## Usage

While the file doesn't provide explicit usage details, it can be inferred that `MISTRAL_LLM_LIST` could be imported in other parts of the application where information about the Mistral models is needed. For example, it could be used to display a list of available models, their details, and their pricing information.

## Structure and Nuance

The file defines four Mistral models: `MISTRAL_7B`, `MIXTRAL`, `MISTRAL_MEDIUM`, and `MISTRAL_LARGE`. Each model is defined as a constant and is added to the `MISTRAL_LLM_LIST` array.

The `MISTRAL_PLATORM_LINK` constant is defined at the top of the file and is used as the `platformLink` for all the models. This suggests that all the models are hosted on the same platform.

The `imageInput` property is set to `false` for all models, indicating that none of these models accept image input.

The `pricing` object is only included for the `MIXTRAL`, `MISTRAL_MEDIUM`, and `MISTRAL_LARGE` models. This could suggest that the `MISTRAL_7B` model is free to use, or that its pricing information is not available or not applicable.
