# chatbot-ui.json

This JSON file is a package.json file, which is a manifest file that's used to manage the project's dependencies, scripts, version, and other metadata. This file is used by Node.js-based projects and is integral to the Node Package Manager (NPM).

## Fields

### name

The `name` field specifies the name of the project, which is "chatbot-ui" in this case.

### version

The `version` field indicates the current version of the project, which is "2.0.0".

### private

The `private` field is a boolean that, when set to true, prevents the package from being accidentally published on npm.

### scripts

The `scripts` field is an object that holds a series of commands that can be executed by running `npm run <command>`. These scripts are used to automate repetitive tasks such as starting the server, running tests, and more. Here are some key scripts:

- `chat`: Starts the Supabase server, generates database types, and runs the development server.
- `restart`: Stops the Supabase server and runs the `chat` script.
- `update`: Pulls the latest changes from the main branch, migrates the database, and generates database types.
- `prepare`: Installs Husky, a tool used for managing git hooks.
- `clean`: Fixes linting issues and formats the code.
- `gen-docs`: Generates documentation using a custom script.
- `dev`, `build`, `start`: Scripts for running the Next.js application in development mode, building the application for production, and starting the production server, respectively.
- `lint`, `lint:fix`: Scripts for linting the code and fixing linting issues.
- `analyze`: Analyzes the build for potential improvements.
- `preview`: Builds the application and starts the production server.
- `type-check`: Checks the code for type errors.
- `format:write`, `format:check`: Scripts for formatting the code and checking if the code is properly formatted.
- `db-reset`, `db-migrate`, `db-types`, `db-pull`, `db-push`: Scripts for managing the database using Supabase.
- `test`: Runs tests using Jest.

### dependencies

The `dependencies` field lists all the libraries and packages that the project needs to run. These dependencies are installed using npm and are required for the application to function. The version number after each package name indicates the version of the package that the project depends on.

### devDependencies

The `devDependencies` field lists all the libraries and packages that are needed for development but are not necessary for running the application. These include packages used for testing, building, and formatting the code.

## Connections

This JSON file is used by npm and Node.js to manage the project's dependencies and scripts. It's also used by various tools and services that integrate with npm, such as CI/CD pipelines, package managers, and code editors.
