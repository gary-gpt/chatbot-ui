# i18nConfig.js

This JavaScript file, `i18nConfig.js`, is responsible for configuring internationalization (i18n) settings for the project. Internationalization is the process of designing a software application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes.

## Exports

The file exports a single object, `i18nConfig`, which contains the configuration settings for internationalization.

### i18nConfig

`i18nConfig` is an object that holds two properties:

- `defaultLocale`: This property is a string that represents the default language locale for the application. In this case, it's set to "en" (English).

- `locales`: This property is an array of strings, each representing a supported language locale. The locales included are Arabic (ar), Bengali (bn), German (de), English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), Hebrew (he), Indonesian (id), Italian (it), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), Portuguese (pt), Russian (ru), Sinhalese (si), Swedish (sv), Telugu (te), Vietnamese (vi), and Chinese (zh).

## Usage

While the file itself doesn't provide direct clues about its usage, it's reasonable to infer that `i18nConfig` is imported in other parts of the application where internationalization is implemented. The `defaultLocale` and `locales` properties are likely used to determine the language settings for the application, based on user preferences or system settings.

## Structure and Nuance

The structure of the `i18nConfig` object is straightforward and easy to understand. It's worth noting that the `locales` array includes a wide variety of languages, suggesting that the application aims to support a diverse user base. The `defaultLocale` is set to English, which might indicate that the primary audience for the application is English-speaking users. However, this could also be changed based on the specific requirements of the project.
