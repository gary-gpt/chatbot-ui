# Filename: Loading.tsx

This file is a TypeScript React component that displays a loading icon on the screen. It uses the `IconLoader2` component from the `@tabler/icons-react` package to display a spinning loading icon.

## Exported Component

### `Loading`

This is a default exported function component. It doesn't accept any props.

When rendered, it displays a div with a full size, centered, spinning loading icon. The div is styled with Tailwind CSS classes to achieve the centering and full size.

#### Usage

This component can be used in any part of the application where a loading state needs to be indicated to the user. Here is an example of how it can be used:

```jsx
import Loading from './Loading';

function SomeComponent() {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? <Loading /> : <div>Content goes here...</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the above example, the `Loading` component is displayed when the `isLoading` state is `true`. When `isLoading` is `false`, the actual content is displayed.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `Loading` component uses the `IconLoader2` component from the `@tabler/icons-react` package. This package provides a set of well-designed SVG icons as React components.

The `IconLoader2` component is styled with the `mt-4`, `size-12`, and `animate-spin` classes. The `mt-4` class adds margin to the top, `size-12` sets the size of the icon, and `animate-spin` applies a spinning animation to the icon.

The parent div uses the `flex`, `size-full`, `flex-col`, `items-center`, and `justify-center` classes to center the loading icon both vertically and horizontally.
