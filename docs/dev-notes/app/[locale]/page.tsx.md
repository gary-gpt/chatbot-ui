# HomePage.tsx

This file is a TypeScript (TSX) file that exports a functional component named `HomePage`. This component is used to render the home page of a chatbot UI application.

## Imports

The file imports several modules and components:

- `ChatbotUISVG` from "@/components/icons/chatbotui-svg": This is a SVG icon for the chatbot UI.
- `IconArrowRight` from "@tabler/icons-react": This is an arrow icon from the Tabler Icons library for React.
- `useTheme` from "next-themes": This is a hook from the Next.js Themes library that allows you to get the current theme.
- `Link` from "next/link": This is a component from Next.js that allows you to create links to other pages in your Next.js application.

## HomePage Function

The `HomePage` function is a functional component that uses the `useTheme` hook to get the current theme. It then returns a JSX element that represents the home page of the application.

The returned JSX element is a `div` that contains:

- A `ChatbotUISVG` component that takes a `theme` prop and a `scale` prop. The `theme` prop is set to "dark" if the current theme is "dark", and "light" otherwise. The `scale` prop is set to 0.3.
- A `div` that contains the text "Chatbot UI".
- A `Link` component that links to the "/login" page. This component contains the text "Start Chatting" and an `IconArrowRight` component.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `HomePage` function uses the `useTheme` hook to dynamically set the theme of the `ChatbotUISVG` component based on the current theme. This allows the icon to adapt to the theme of the application.

The `Link` component uses the `href` prop to specify the URL of the page to link to. This is a feature of Next.js that allows you to create links to other pages in your application.

The `IconArrowRight` component inside the `Link` component is used to visually indicate that clicking the link will take the user to a new page.
