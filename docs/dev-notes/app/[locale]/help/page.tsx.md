# HelpPage.tsx

This file exports a default function `HelpPage` which is a functional component in React. This component is used to display a help page in a web application.

## Function: HelpPage

The `HelpPage` function returns a JSX element which is a `div` with a class name of "size-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center". This class name suggests that the `div` is styled to take up the full screen size and its children are displayed in a column, centered both vertically and horizontally.

Inside this `div`, there is another `div` with a class name of "text-4xl". This suggests that the text inside this `div` is displayed with a large font size. The text displayed is "Help under construction."

### Usage

The `HelpPage` function is a default export, so it can be imported into another file using the `import` statement without curly braces. Since it's a functional component, it can be used in the JSX of another component like so:

```jsx
import HelpPage from './HelpPage';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <HelpPage />
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `HelpPage` component is used inside the `App` component.

### Structure and Nuance

The structure of the `HelpPage` function is quite simple as it only contains two `div` elements. The outer `div` is used for layout and positioning, while the inner `div` is used to display text.

The nuance in this file is the use of CSS classes to style the `div` elements. The class names suggest that a CSS-in-JS library like Tailwind CSS might be used in this project. However, without the actual CSS or configuration files, this is just an educated guess.
