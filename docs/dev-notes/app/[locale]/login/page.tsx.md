# Login.tsx

This TypeScript file is responsible for the login functionality of the application. It provides the user with the ability to sign in, sign up, and reset their password. The file also handles the redirection of the user to their home workspace after successful login or sign up.

## Exports

The file exports a single default asynchronous function `Login` which is responsible for the entire login functionality.

## Metadata

The `metadata` object is exported from the file and it contains the title of the page, which is "Login".

## Functions

### Login

The `Login` function is an asynchronous function that takes an object with a `searchParams` property as an argument. The `searchParams` object contains a `message` string. This function is responsible for handling user login, sign up, and password reset.

### signIn

The `signIn` function is an asynchronous function that takes a `FormData` object as an argument. It is responsible for signing in the user. If the sign-in is successful, the user is redirected to their home workspace. If there is an error, the user is redirected back to the login page with an error message.

### signUp

The `signUp` function is an asynchronous function that takes a `FormData` object as an argument. It is responsible for signing up a new user. If the sign-up is successful, the user is redirected to the setup page. If there is an error, the user is redirected back to the login page with an error message.

### handleResetPassword

The `handleResetPassword` function is an asynchronous function that takes a `FormData` object as an argument. It is responsible for handling password reset requests. If the request is successful, the user is redirected to the login page with a message to check their email to reset their password. If there is an error, the user is redirected back to the login page with an error message.

## Usage

The `Login` function is likely used as a component in a larger application, rendering a form that allows users to sign in, sign up, or reset their password. It uses several UI components such as `Brand`, `Input`, `Label`, and `SubmitButton` to construct the form. It also uses the `createClient` and `createServerClient` functions from the `supabase` library to handle user authentication.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `Login` function uses the `supabase` library to handle user authentication. It also uses environment variables to get the Supabase URL and anonymous key. The function also uses the `cookies` function from the `next/headers` library to handle cookies.

The `signIn`, `signUp`, and `handleResetPassword` functions are defined within the `Login` function and are used as form actions. These functions use the `redirect` function from the `next/navigation` library to redirect the user after successful sign-in, sign-up, or password reset.

The `signUp` function also checks if the user's email is allowed to sign up based on a whitelist of email domains and email addresses. This is an interesting feature that can be used to restrict sign-ups to certain domains or email addresses.
