# ChangePasswordPage.tsx

This file is a React component that serves as a page for changing a user's password. It uses the Supabase client library for authentication and session management, and the Next.js router for navigation.

## Exports

The file exports a single default function, `ChangePasswordPage`.

### ChangePasswordPage

This is a React functional component that handles the rendering of the change password page. It uses the `useState` hook to manage a loading state, and the `useEffect` hook to check the user's session on component mount.

If the user is not logged in (i.e., there is no session), they are redirected to the login page. If the user is logged in, the loading state is set to false and the `ChangePassword` component is rendered.

## Dependencies

This file imports several dependencies:

- `ChangePassword` from "@/components/utility/change-password": This is a React component that provides the UI and functionality for changing a user's password.
- `supabase` from "@/lib/supabase/browser-client": This is the Supabase client library, used here for session management and authentication.
- `useRouter` from "next/navigation": This is a hook provided by Next.js that allows access to the router instance.
- `useEffect` and `useState` from "react": These are React hooks used for side effects and state management, respectively.

## Usage

This component is likely used as part of a route in a Next.js application. When the route corresponding to this component is visited, the component checks if the user is logged in. If not, the user is redirected to the login page. If the user is logged in, the `ChangePassword` component is rendered, allowing the user to change their password.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `useEffect` hook is used here to perform an asynchronous operation on component mount. This is done by defining an async function inside the `useEffect` callback and immediately invoking it. This pattern is used because the `useEffect` callback itself cannot be async.

The loading state is used to prevent the `ChangePassword` component from rendering until the user's session has been checked. If the loading state is true, the component returns `null`, rendering nothing.
