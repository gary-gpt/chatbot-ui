# RootLayout.tsx

This file is a part of a Chatbot UI application and it serves as the root layout for the application. It sets up the global state, providers, and translations for the application. It also configures the metadata and viewport for the application.

## Exports

### `metadata: Metadata`

This is an object that contains the metadata for the application. It includes the application name, title, description, manifest, appleWebApp configuration, format detection, open graph and twitter card information.

### `viewport: Viewport`

This is an object that sets the theme color for the viewport of the application.

### `RootLayout`

This is the default export of the file. It's an asynchronous function that takes in `RootLayoutProps` as parameters and returns a JSX element. It sets up the cookie store, Supabase client, session, and translations. It then returns the root layout of the application with the providers, translations, and global state.

## Types

### `RootLayoutProps`

This is an interface that defines the props for the `RootLayout` function. It includes `children` of type `ReactNode` and `params` which is an object that contains `locale` of type `string`.

## Usage

The `RootLayout` function is likely used as the root component of the application. It wraps the entire application with the necessary providers and global state. It also sets up the translations based on the locale provided in the `params`.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `RootLayout` function uses the `createServerClient` function from `@supabase/ssr` to create a Supabase client with the public Supabase URL and anonymous key from the environment variables. It also sets up a cookie store and uses it to get the value of a cookie in the `get` method of the `cookies` option in the `createServerClient` function.

The `RootLayout` function also uses the `initTranslations` function to initialize the translations for the application. It passes the locale and an array containing "translation" as the namespaces to the `initTranslations` function.

The `RootLayout` function returns a JSX element that includes the `Providers`, `TranslationsProvider`, and `Toaster` components from the application's UI components. It also includes a `GlobalState` component that wraps the `children` if there is a session, otherwise it just includes the `children`.
