# envKeyMap.ts

This TypeScript file is part of a larger project and is responsible for managing environment keys for various API providers. It exports a single asynchronous function, `GET()`, which checks if the environment keys for each provider are being used and returns a response with this information.

## Exports

### `GET()`

This is an asynchronous function that creates a map of environment keys for various API providers and checks if these keys are being used. The function then returns a response with this information.

The function uses the `isUsingEnvironmentKey()` function from the `@/lib/envs` module to check if an environment key is being used. It also uses the `createResponse()` function from the `@/lib/server/server-utils` module to create a response.

The function creates a map, `envKeyMap`, with the keys being the names of the API providers and the values being the corresponding environment keys. The function then creates another map, `isUsingEnvKeyMap`, with the keys being the names of the API providers and the values being booleans indicating whether the corresponding environment key is being used.

The function finally returns a response with the `isUsingEnvKeyMap` map and a status code of 200.

## Usage

This file is likely used in a server-side context, where it's important to know which environment keys are being used. The `GET()` function can be called to get a response with this information. The response can then be used to take appropriate action, such as logging the information or displaying it in a user interface.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The `GET()` function uses the `reduce()` method to create the `isUsingEnvKeyMap` map. This is an efficient way to create a new map from an existing one, as it avoids the need to create a separate loop.

The function also uses TypeScript's `Record` utility type to specify the types of the keys and values in the `envKeyMap` and `isUsingEnvKeyMap` maps. This provides strong type checking, ensuring that the keys are strings and the values are of the appropriate type.
