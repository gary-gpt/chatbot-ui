# `package.json` File Documentation

This file is a `package.json` file, a standard file in Node.js projects. It is used to define the properties of a project, including its name, version, description, main entry point, scripts, keywords, author, license, and dependencies.

## File Purpose

The `package.json` file serves as a manifest for the project, providing metadata and configuration details. It is essential for managing dependencies and scripts in a Node.js project.

## Exports and Functions

This file does not directly export any functions or types, but it does define several scripts that can be run using the `npm run` command.

## Scripts

There are three scripts defined in this file:

1. `integration`: This script runs the `playwright test` command, which runs integration tests using the Playwright testing framework.

2. `integration:open`: This script runs the `playwright test --ui` command, which opens a user interface for running and viewing the results of the Playwright tests.

3. `integration:codegen`: This script runs the `playwright codegen` command, which generates code for Playwright tests.

## Dependencies

The `devDependencies` section lists the development dependencies for the project. These are packages that are not required for the application to run, but are needed for development purposes (like testing or building the project).

There are two development dependencies listed:

1. `@playwright/test`: This is the Playwright testing framework, which is used to write and run the integration tests defined in the scripts section.

2. `@types/node`: This package provides TypeScript definitions for Node.js, allowing TypeScript to understand the types used in Node.js.

## Usage

To use the scripts defined in this file, you would run `npm run <script-name>`. For example, to run the `integration` script, you would use the command `npm run integration`.

## Interesting Structure or Nuance

The use of the `:` character in the script names (`integration:open`, `integration:codegen`) is a common convention in Node.js projects. It allows related scripts to be grouped together by a common prefix, making it easier to understand their purpose at a glance.
