# jest.config.ts

This TypeScript file is used to configure Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, for a Next.js application. It uses the `next/jest` package to create a Jest configuration that is compatible with Next.js.

## Exports

The file exports a single default function, `createJestConfig`, which returns a Jest configuration object. This function is exported in this way to ensure that `next/jest` can load the Next.js configuration, which is asynchronous.

## Types

The `Config` type is imported from the `jest` package. This type is used to define the shape of the Jest configuration object.

## Functions

The `nextJest` function is imported from the `next/jest.js` package. This function is used to create a Jest configuration that is compatible with Next.js. It takes an object as an argument, which should contain a `dir` property that specifies the path to the Next.js application.

## Configuration

The Jest configuration object is created by calling the `nextJest` function and passing in an object with a `dir` property set to `"./"`. This tells `next/jest` to load the Next.js configuration and `.env` files from the current directory.

The configuration object is then extended with additional Jest configuration options. In this case, the `coverageProvider` is set to `"v8"`, and the `testEnvironment` is set to `"jsdom"`. These options specify that code coverage should be collected using the V8 coverage provider, and that tests should be run in a jsdom environment.

There is also a commented-out `setupFilesAfterEnv` option, which can be used to specify setup files that should be run after the test environment has been set up, but before tests are run.

## Usage

To use this configuration, you would typically import it in your Jest test files or in your Jest CLI command. Since it is exported as a default export, you would import it like this:

```javascript
import createJestConfig from './jest.config.ts'
```

Then, you would pass the configuration object to Jest when running your tests.
